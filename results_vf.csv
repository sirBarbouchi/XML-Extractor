<p><em>Caitlin Dickerson | The Atlantic | August 8th, 2022 | 28,600 words</em></p>
<p>Go ahead and give Caitlin Dickerson a Pulitzer. Her examination of the Trump administration’s family separation policy is a reporting tour de force and an American horror story that should be read and studied as long as the republic stands. I could only read it in pieces. One go was too much — my heart couldn’t take it. Dickerson shows that some elected officials and bureaucrats acted out of a toxic combination of malice and ambition, while even more did nothing because they were too cowardly or navel-gazing. She holds them all to account, particularly those with children of their own. “‘Can you hold on? My daughter is about to get in her car to leave and I need to kiss her goodbye,’ one government official said as she was in the middle of describing a spreadsheet of hundreds of complaints from parents searching for their children,” Dickerson writes. A single phrase came to mind when I finished reading: “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler%27s_Willing_Executioners?src=longreads"" rel=""nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer"" aria-expanded=""false"">willing executioners</a>.” —<a href=""https://twitter.com/seywarddarby"">SD</a></p>

Seven Stowaways and a Hijacked Oil Tanker: The Strange Case of The Nave Andromeda</a></h2>
<p><em>Samira Shackle | The Guardian | June 9th, 2022 | 5,925 words</em></p>
<p>Samira Shackle’s investigation is a gripping lesson in not taking things at face value. Exploring the story of “a heroic mission to defeat a hijacking in the Channel,” instead of finding “marauding Nigerian pirates,” she discovers scared and lonely men, still coming to terms with what happened to them after being brought ashore in the U.K. Any threat is dubious at best. The crew of the Nave Andromeda was likely just desperate to find a way to dock — perhaps even through a feigned distress call — having been turned away from Spain and France for having seven stowaways aboard. Shackle offers tremendous reporting on both this one event and the broader immigration issue of which it is part — while managing to keep humanity at the forefront. Her words paint an all too vivid picture of the rudder stock — the space around a pole that links the rudder to the steering room inside the ship — where the seven men clung on for nine days before being discovered, too scared to fall asleep in case they fell into the swirling sea below. Shackle focuses on Michael, fleeing from a gang in Lagos that killed his mother, and his bewilderment at being put into detention is heartbreaking. It is Shackle who helps clarify what has happened: &#8220;[H]e handed me a crumpled bail notice from the police and asked me to explain it. When I said that the case had been dropped, pulling up a BBC report from the previous January on my phone, he began to cry. ‘I didn’t know that,’ he said.” —<a href=""https://twitter.com/wells_ca"">CW</a></p>

<p><em>Mitchell S. Jackson | Esquire | August 8th, 2022 | 6,500 words</em></p>
<p>“My god, dude, what the hell happened to you?” That’s the central question of Pulitzer Prize winner Mitchell S. Jackson’s new profile of Clarence Thomas. Except it’s not a profile in the traditional sense. It’s a rumination, a scream, a plea. Jackson, whose writing always seems to pour from his veins as much as it unspools from his brain, visits Thomas’ boyhood home in low country Georgia, where he was nicknamed “Boy” and grew up speaking Gullah, and his current home in Fairfax, Virginia, where Thomas “retires to on days he and his colleagues announce the usurping of more rights.” Jackson is seeking clues for how a Black man could come to make his life’s work the subjugation of his own people, among many other long-marginalized groups. I was moved by the honest desperation of this piece. Jackson’s work shimmers with pain. —<a href=""https://twitter.com/seywarddarby"">SD</a></p>

<p><em>Roberto José Andrade Franco | ESPN | July 27th, 2022 | 7,314 words</em></p>
<p>Two weeks ago, I read Roberto José Andrade Franco’s piece on the devastating loss of one Uvalde family, and I’m still thinking about it. Franco traces a history of Texas shaped by guns, violence, and segregation, but also comes in close to share the story of 10-year-old Tess Mata, one of the children murdered in the Robb Elementary School shooting, who loved softball and dancing — and had her entire life ahead of her. The photographs by Verónica G. Cárdenas are haunting — snapshots of Tess, her family, her bedroom and belongings — but so are the scenes from Tess’ life conjured from Franco’s words. I can’t stop imagining, for instance, a determined Tess throwing a softball in her family’s backyard, aiming practice pitches at a sugar maple tree in the Texas heat. A heartbreaking but necessary read. —<a href=""https://twitter.com/cherilucas"" rel=""nofollow ugc"">CLR</a></p>

<p><em>Ian Dille</em> | <em>Texas Monthly</em> | <em>August 10th, 2022</em> | <em>3,938 words</em></p>
<p>Recent years have seen an explosion of discussion around racial gaps in outdoor recreation — finally. Despite rapidly proliferating groups like <a href=""https://outdoorafro.org/?src=longreads"">Outdoor Afro</a> and the <a href=""http://www.majortaylorassociation.org/AssociatedClubs.shtml?src=longreads"">Major Taylor Cycling Club</a>, retail brands and shops seemed almost inertially resistant to reaching beyond their assumed audience. (&#8220;I love Patagonia products, but their marketing materials make the luxury of intentionally living in your van seem admirable, even altruistic,&#8221; <a href=""https://www.levelman.com/on-being-black-outside-8b635d9a7ce9/?src=longreads"">Nicholas Russell wrote in 2020</a>. &#8220;The activities that outdoor companies present, whether climbing or running or snowboarding, isn’t correlated to what’s possible; it’s more about who fits the concept of that activity, who is likely to afford to buy into it.&#8221;) It’s that pattern that Jahmichah Dawes has sought to disrupt, opening an outdoors shop in small-town Texas. As such, Dawes has found himself a poster child of sorts, a symbol of something far bigger than just a man and his dream — whether he wanted to be or not. But as Ian Dille’s <em>Texas Monthly</em> profile makes clear, it’s a challenge he’s met with perseverance and mission clarity. And outdoor enthusiasts everywhere are better for it. —<a href=""https://twitter.com/provenself"">PR</a></p>

<p class=""has-drop-cap"">Before the arrival<strong> </strong>of European colonizers, the Columbia Plateau, which forms swaths of present-day Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, was home to several Native tribes, including the Nez Perce, Wenatchi, Palus, and Colville. Foreigners brought with them disease and destruction. They also brought horses. “It was probably the best gift the white man ever gave us,” the late Stampede organizer and horse trainer Eddie Timentwa told author Carol Austin, who wrote a book about the Suicide Race in 1993,</p>
<p>By the 1700s, horsemanship had become an integral part of Native culture. The animals assisted in transportation and territorial expansion. “Mounted war parties could strike enemies at greater distances and with greater force than ever before,” writes anthropologist Deward Walker. Horses also led to larger traditional gatherings, allowing more people from a wider geographical range to come together. During salmon-spawning season, plateau tribes would meet at the confluence of the Sanpoil and Columbia Rivers to harvest and dry the coming winter’s supply of fish. Horses served as entertainment and objects of sporting competition. Riders paraded horses adorned with tribal regalia and beaded stirrups and bridles before running perilous mountain races.</p>
<p>After the plateau tribes were forced onto the Colville Reservation, the tradition of horse racing continued, and people wagered on riders. Stories of these events were most often passed down through oral tradition, but in 1879, Erskine Wood, a U.S. military officer, wrote of one horse race, “It did not take long for the excitement to grow and soon the bets were showering down and the pile swelling visibly with such great rapidity that it was marvelous how account could be kept. Blankets, furs, saddles, knives, traps, tobacco, beads, whips, and a hundred other things were staked.” (Wood wrote positively of many of his encounters with Native tribes, but also participated in the violent removal of the Nez Perce from their ancestral land.)</p>
<p>In the 1920s, Hugh McShane, a white man married to a Colville woman, introduced a mountain race at the rodeo in Keller, Washington. The race, described by Austin as “a half mile, pell-mell down a nearly vertical, boulder-strewn chasm in the face of a mountain,” quickly became a crowd favorite. But it wouldn’t last: The construction of the Grand Coulee Dam in the 1930s flooded Keller, forcing residents to relocate. In Omak, about 60 miles northwest, Claire Pentz, a furniture salesman in charge of publicity for the town’s rodeo, heard about McShane’s event and decided to stage one of his own. Locals brainstormed what to call the starting location, a precipitous incline on the Okanogan’s southern bank. Murder Hill was floated, but organizers settled on Suicide Hill. “The suicide race draws only the most nervy riders,” <em>The Omak Chronicle</em> declared.</p>
<p>In 1942, a jockey named Bev Conners drowned in the river during the race. Since then, according to various sources, no other jockeys have died. But injuries are common, including grievous ones. Larry Peasley, who taught Andres how to ride a mechanical bull, has two adult children who were nearly killed in the race. In 2002, his daughter Naomie—one of only a few women to ever run the race—suffered a skull fracture and flatlined on the way to the hospital. Doctors were able to revive her. A few years later, Peasley’s son Tyler went somersaulting off his horse and was trampled by oncoming riders. He fractured his ribs and suffered a broken pelvis and hip.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to see what makes the race so dangerous. There’s the hill itself, more than 200 feet of earth pitched at a harrowing angle—according to one race organizer’s measurement, it’s steeper than the Great Pyramid of Giza. Riders charge down the slope at full gallop, reaching speeds up to 30 miles per hour by the time they hit the river. Then there’s the lack of any hard-and-fast rules about how the race should be run. Horses aren’t lined up in an orderly fashion at the starting line. What happens on Suicide Hill is a free-for-all, with mounted jockeys jostling each other, fighting for a competitive spot. The aggression only escalates during the race. Riders violently whipping other jockeys in the face with their crops, attempting to throw them off balance or slow them down, is a common tactic, and often a successful one.</p>
<p>The best Suicide Race jockeys are adrenaline junkies, as athletic as they are knowledgeable of the event’s 1,260-foot-long course. They’ve meticulously mapped out the quarter-mile and know what to do when: Lean back before this point, lock your knees here, sit forward just after that section, pull back the reins there. Riders have incredible core and leg strength to help them stay in the saddle, and they know how far their bodies can tilt sideways if need be, to avoid injury or inflict it on a competitor.</p>
<p>In 2002, the race’s all-time reigning champ, Alex Dick, passed away at the age of 83. He had 16 King of the Hill titles to his name; his obituary in a local newspaper noted that Dick, who was Native, “set a record that will probably never be broken.” So far it hasn’t been. Yet if there’s a first family of the Suicide Race today, it’s the Marchands. Three brothers—Loren, Francis, and Edward—have followed in the footsteps of their grandfather, Jim, an endurance racer who died after a horse fell on him in 1990, and an uncle, George, who holds three Suicide Race titles. Loren, now 34, has been crowned King of the Hill seven times, most recently in 2015. Francis and Edward have never won the overall title, but they’ve come close.</p>
<p>As the dominant force in the Suicide Race, the Marchand brothers have a wealth of tips and tricks, and they know all the best places around Omak to practice. But the race is a tradition most often shared among kin, and the Marchands are notoriously wary of letting people who aren’t blood, or at least Native, into their inner circle. They also reject weekend warriors and wannabe jockeys who are in it purely for the exhilaration. “The Marchands don’t fuck with anybody,” said Conner Picking, a Suicide Race jockey and a great-grandson of one of the founders of the Omak Stampede.</p>
<p>That didn’t stop Andres from trying to get their attention.</p>
<p class=""has-text-align-center"" style=""text-align:center;"">***</p>
<p class=""has-text-align-center"" style=""text-align:left;"">By the summer of 2018, Andres, now 26, had cleaned up his life and was working construction and picking up jobs as a handyman. He was also holding fast to his desire to learn from Suicide Race royalty, looking for a way in to their good graces. One day he accompanied a welder to a small ranch in Eastside owned by Preston Boyd, a Colville elder renowned for breeding and training thoroughbreds for flat-track racing. Boyd needed the men to fix his broken horse walker, a motorized machine that leads horses in a circle. While Andres worked, Boyd took a good look at him. He noticed Andres’s height—just five feet six inches. He probed the young man about his weight.</p>
<p>Boyd was searching for a new rider to exercise his racehorses, because his usual guys were getting too busy. Among them was his great-nephew, Francis Marchand. Francis was helping Boyd break some new horses that summer, but his schedule was increasingly packed with rodeos—a formidable horseman, Francis regularly competed in saddle bronc and bareback riding. Andres’s specs were promising for the kind of rider Boyd needed. Sure, he couldn’t gallop a horse yet, but he could learn. Boyd told Andres he might fit the bill.</p>
<p>Andres knew he was being given a rare opportunity—a chance to get to know Boyd and one of the Marchands, and to show that he had what it took to run the Suicide Race. But months went by and nothing happened. Boyd never followed up with Andres about exercising his horses.</p>
<p>Omak is the kind of place where everybody knows everybody, and sometimes Andres bumped into Francis at social gatherings. He would bring up Boyd’s suggestion that he was rider material as casually as he could, to see if Francis knew anything about his great-uncle’s plans. Andres also asked about going off the hill—what it felt like, what it took to win. Francis recognized Andres’s ambition, and in early 2019 he told him to stop dithering and get to the point: If he wanted to become a rider, he should go to Boyd and say so. “You want to do this? Look him in the eyes,” Francis said. “In any culture, you grab a guy, shake his hand, and tell him you want this.”</p>
<p>Andres took the advice to heart, but he didn’t want to seem desperate. He waited until he ran into Boyd at a gas station one day, then asked if he could help exercise his horses. Boyd said sure, and Andres showed up at 7:30 the next morning to start learning.</p>
<p>Unlike bull riding, which Andres took to easily as a boy, riding racehorses was challenging. Though short, he was stocky and muscular; working construction had made him strong, but he wasn’t nimble or quick to respond to a horse’s stride. Montana Pakootas, a seasoned jockey who helped out on the ranch, had to constantly remind Andres not to yank the reins, but to pull them gently, if he wanted to slow a horse down. “Use your wrist, not your whole arm,” Pakootas said. Otherwise, when a horse was going full speed, Andres risked throwing it off balance.</p>
<p>Andres’s riding improved, and by the summer of 2019 he was exercising Boyd’s newest racehorses for several hours most days of the week. Boyd expected his riders to stick to a routine, for the horses’ sake. “I take Wednesdays and Sundays off to let their muscles, if they get sore, to give them a little rest,” he said. On training days, it was Andres’s job to guide horses to a trot around a local track for a quarter of a mile, getting their blood pumping and helping them build stamina. Eventually he would get them up to a gallop. As a horse became more aerobic, Andres learned to increase its speed against its pulse, maintaining a low heart rate even while the horse worked hard over varying distances. After weeks or months of training, when a horse was comfortable running at top speed around the track in Omak, Andres took the horse to Emerald Downs, a race facility in Seattle, not to compete but to get acquainted with crowds and the whirring sound the starting gates make when they open.</p>
<p>Andres exercised Boyd’s horses for free, and he and Renteria, who was selling Amway products at the time, sometimes struggled to cover the bills. Andres picked up odd jobs where he could, but not anything that took away from his time with Boyd’s horses. The Suicide Race was never far from his mind. He watched videos of past races over and over, studying them. “He’d always say, ‘I hope I go down the hill one day,’ but I never thought he would actually be in it,” Renteria said. Sometimes Andres was surprised he still had a girlfriend at all. “He told me that he thought I’d break up with him since all he did was ride,” Renteria said, smiling.</p>
<p>One day, when Andres had been working with Montana Pakootas for a while, he decided to tell him about his ultimate goal. Pakootas, who had run many Suicide Races and was crowned King of the Hill in 2004, was hosing down a horse at the time. In response to what Andres said, he turned and sprayed him in the face. That’s how the hazing began. Another time Pakootas dumped a boot full of water on Andres’s head. “You scared of getting wet? Because that water fucking feels like it just whips you in the face,” he said, referring to the dive into the Okanogan River. Andres was humiliated, but he kept showing up, kept taking shit.</p>
<p>When Boyd asked him to come along to Emerald Downs for an official racing event, Andres jumped at the chance. At the Downs, Andres awoke every morning at 4:45 to feed the racehorses, then got them ready for the day’s competitions. Francis Marchand and his brother Edward were there, helping care for Boyd’s horses, and they picked up Andres’s hazing where Pakootas had left off. “Edward wasn’t easy on me, that’s for sure,” Andres said. The eldest Marchand brother, known for his success in the extreme sport of Indian relay racing, in which a rider changes his mount mid-competition, seemed to notice every mistake Andres made while warming up the horses. “It’s almost like he waited for me to fuck up,” Andres said, “just so he could go off on me and drive me away.”</p>
<p>Andres persevered, and over margaritas at an Applebee’s one day, he felt bold enough to say it to Edward straight—what he wanted, what he was sure he was capable of. What did he need to do to go off the hill? Edward, who had placed second overall in the 2018 Suicide Race, shook his head in response.</p>
<p>“You don’t have what it takes,” he said.</p>
<p>“What’s it take?” Andres asked.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter. You don’t got it.”</p>

<p><em>Janelle Nanos | The Boston Globe Magazine | July 28th, 2022 | 11,329 words</em></p>
<p>I would be remiss if I didn’t start by noting that Janelle Nanos’s story contains graphic details of childhood sexual abuse — some readers may want to proceed with caution, or not at all. Should you choose to click through, you will find a feat of narrative journalism, as propulsive as it is compassionate. As an adult, Kate Price, an authority on child sex trafficking, began to remember being abused by her father, grandfather, and other men. But no one believed her. Even she wasn’t sure she could trust her memories. So, in collaboration with Nanos over roughly a decade, Price went looking for evidence of what her brain told her had happened. I won’t reveal what they found; readers should experience it in the context of Nanos’s excellent prose. I’ll just say that the piece took my breath away. Twice. —<a href=""https://twitter.com/seywarddarby"">SD</a></p>
<h2><a href=""https://href.li/?https://maisonneuve.org/article/2022/06/24/where-theres-smoke/?src=longreads"">2. Where There’s Smoke</a></h2>
<p><em>Paloma Pacheo | Maisonneuve | June 24th, 2022 | 5,764 words</em></p>
<p>Although no wine connoisseur, I have been to the Okanagan Valley — a wine region in British Columbia — several times. I enjoy sitting on a vineyard patio, cockily swirling a big glass round and round while I pretend to detect oaky notes or hints of grass (all I smell is the reassuring whiff of alcohol.) The last time I was there, the air was also sadly filled with the smell of smoke as wildfires burned across the region. Although I feared for properties in the area, it never crossed my mind to consider the wine itself; but for those who can taste the difference between a cab sav and a merlot, the tinge of smoke is a growing concern.<em> </em>In this essay, Paloma Pacheco persuades several Okanagan winemakers to discuss the threat of “smoke taint” — still quite a taboo topic outside the industry. The taint occurs when compounds in woodsmoke bind to sugars in a ripening grape’s skin, and with wildfires growing in intensity each year, the risk of wine tasting, in Pacheco’s words, “like you’re licking the bottom of an ashtray,” has grown in many wine regions. Wine is a low priority in the many challenges of a burning world, but Pacheco points out that “the solutions that winemakers and growers have adopted represent a form of resilience many of us can learn from.” A riveting read. —<a href=""https://twitter.com/wells_ca?lang=en"">CW</a></p>

<p><em>Radley Balko | Nashville Scene | July 28th, 2022 | 8,219 words</em></p>
<p>Nashville isn’t the only American city to have seen a recent spike in both population and gentrification; it’s also not the only city to have a byzantine set of zoning codes governing what can and can’t happen on a person’s property. But when you put those two things together, as Radley Balko explores in this investigation, you get a perfect storm of bureaucracy-perpetuated inequity. Real-estate developers and property-value-minded neighbors anonymously call the Metro Codes Department on longtime residents, many of whom are older, Black, and poor — and almost none of whom (Balko included) can fight the compounding deluge of citations. That’s not even considering the bloated city council that’s uniquely susceptible to lobbying from housing associations, and thus not exactly disposed to address this syndrome at the root.

<p><em>Claire McNear| The Ringer | July 29th, 2022 | 3,000 words</em></p>
<p>I remember laboring over sociology essays on classic moral panics such as the <a href=""https://href.li/?https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20140515-when-two-tribes-went-to-war"" rel=""nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer"">Mods and Rockers </a>(two British youth subcultures, supposedly rather fond of beating each other up.) However, I never learned about parents getting flustered over colorful jelly bracelets. Luckily, Claire McNear is here to fill me in with this captivating essay on why seemingly innocuous bands became labeled as sex bracelets and banned from schools across the U.S. McNear explains, in far more entertaining terms than any of my turgid tomes on the topic, how the fear behind a moral panic is a “perception problem.” In this case, people assuming “the generation or generations behind them are more salacious.” There is little evidence that middle schoolers in the early 2000s were actually busy snapping bracelets to indicate sex acts — it was all far more Brady Bunch than the grown-ups would ever have suspected. —<a href=""https://twitter.com/wells_ca?lang=en"">CW</a></p>

<p><em>Tad Friend | The New Yorker | Aug 1st, 2022 | 9,497 words</em></p>
<p>Where do I even begin to endorse Tad Friend’s safari into the world of modern-day door-to-door salespeople? First, I guess, would be the disclaimer that this sort of subculture piece is catnip for me. I’m a sucker for industry argot, from “bageling” to “tie-downs” to the BOLT system. I’m a sucker for play-by-play annotations, as when Friend details the conversations that Taggart — would-be king of the “knockers” — has with the folks unlucky enough to answer the door and expose themselves to his white-toothed psychological siege. I’m a sucker for anything that plumbs the depths of alpha-bro “performance” thinking, foreign as it is to my character. But that’s only the starting point. What Friend delivers here is a portrait of the want that plagues so many of us, a want for success that’s really a want for redemption. It fuels the cold calls, the seminars, the mind games. “Failure is abhorrent because it can induce a contagious loss of faith in the whole enterprise,” he writes. That was likely the case in the days of Fuller brushes and vacuum cleaners, and it’s certainly the case today, with the knockers peddling home-security systems and high-commission solar panels. Somehow as devastating as it is entertaining. —<a href=""https://twitter.com/provenself"" rel=""nofollow ugc"">PR</a></p>

<p><em>Kelsey Vlamis | Insider | July 22nd, 2022 | 6,612 words</em></p>
<p>On an attempt to summit Alaska’s Denali, the tallest peak in North America, Adam Rawski fell 1,000 feet down the Autobahn, a dangerous slope that has claimed more lives than any other part of the mountain. Incredibly, he survived. But as Kelsey Vlamis recounts in this story, there’s much more to that day. How did Rawski end up climbing with three strangers? Why weren’t they roped for protection? The physical conditions alone on Denali — the high altitude, the extreme cold, the exhaustion — are a challenge for even the most seasoned mountaineers. But Rawski’s party also included a mix of inexperience and overconfidence, and was plagued by a lack of communication and odd team dynamics. Inevitably, their expedition was a total recipe for disaster. I’m not at all into mountain climbing, but Vlamis’ account of this adventure-gone-wrong gripped me ’til the end. —<a href=""https://twitter.com/cherilucas"" rel=""nofollow ugc"">CLR</a></p>

<p><em>Brian Feldman</em> | <em>Defector</em> | <em>July 19th, 2022</em> | <em>3,407 words</em></p>
<p>Back in 2015 — remember the innocence? — <em>Vanity Fair</em> ran a piece by Darryn King called <a href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/10/ermahgerd-girl-true-story/?src=longreads"" rel=""nofollow ugc noreferrer"" aria-expanded=""false"">“Ermahgerddon: The Untold Story of the Ermahgerd Girl.”</a> I don’t know for sure whether this was the first longform journalistic investigation into a meme, but I do know that it was a) the first I remember, and b) an absolute joy. That said, I have to say that Brian Feldman’s recent <em>Defector</em> feature surpasses it. The meme in question isn’t even a meme in the current sense; it’s neither photo nor GIF, but a video clip. And that video clip of an errant fullcourt basketball shot connecting with a small child’s head, which has been circulating online since the heyday of Limewire and eBaum’s World, is so ancient, so pixilated, that identifying the people within it feels like a futile endeavor. Not for Feldman. In opposition of “Erhmagerddon,” the journalist-turned-software-engineer starts not with the solution, but with the mystery. He solves it, of course, but he also delivers an evocative tour of the internet as it used to be. To describe is to spoil, so I’ll let him take you the rest of the way. You’re in good hands. —<a href=""https://twitter.com/provenself"" rel=""nofollow ugc"" aria-expanded=""false"">PR</a></p>

<p>Always read Skip Hollandsworth. It’s really that simple. He’s one of the best storytellers in the business. Exhibit A: his latest piece about a possible serial killer in Fort Worth. It’s the best kind of true crime yarn, with no frills, no fuss, and no salaciousness. Hollandsworth’s portrayal of death, grief, and justice is humane at every turn. It features a rich cast of characters, a couple of left-field surprises — a trip to CrimeCon, for instance — and a fascinating face-to-face encounter with the killer in question, now serving time for the 1974 murder of a teenager named Carla Walker. I read this piece eating popcorn (literally). And as a writer and editor, I was taking mental notes. —<a href=""https://twitter.com/seywarddarby"">SD</a></p>

<p><em>Tessa Somberg | The Cut | July 28th, 2022 | 3,760 words</em></p>
<p>New York legalized surrogacy in 2021. And what a time to do so: in the midst of a pandemic, on the precipice of the overturning of <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, during an upswing of anti-LGBTQ+ bigotry and panic over “family values” — in short, when so much about personal health and agency over one’s body feels more fraught than ever. Tessa Somberg profiles three women who chose to be some of the first surrogates in New York, and the result is as intimate and compassionate as you&#8217;d hope. “What’s more powerful to a woman,” asks Portia, one of the surrogates, “than the choice to do what she wants with her uterus?” What, indeed. —<a href=""https://twitter.com/seywarddarby"">SD</a></p>

<p>“Sure,” you think. “I’m allergic to cold, too.” But this isn’t the always-need-a-sweater type of thing. It’s not that you feel cold; it’s that your body rebels against it. Itching. Swelling. Hives. And that’s just the beginning. When Alison Espach began experiencing the symptoms of what she later learned was cold urticaria, she doubted it too. Yet, the more she confronted the rare autoimmune response, the more she was forced to confront the long-past familial tragedy that may have been at its root. “Some people thought they were cured and woke up one day to find that they weren’t,” she writes. “When they least expected it, when they were out walking and a cold wind blew, their throat closed. I think of these people when I am packing for a hike, when I am headed by myself to the ocean. I wonder if I will become one of them. I wonder when tragedy will strike again.” A searching, confidently paced chronicle of a situation that’s somehow both unbelievable and all too relatable. —<a href=""https://twitter.com/provenself"" rel=""nofollow ugc"">PR</a></p>

http://longreads.com/rss,More Than a Feeling: A Blues Reading List,"<p style=""text-align:center;""><em>By <a href=""https://twitter.com/chriswheatley01"">Chris Wheatley</a></em></p>
<p>“Before Elvis there was nothing,” John Lennon famously once said about his own musical awakening — but, as Presley himself frequently acknowledged, there would have been no Elvis without the blues.  It&#8217;s no exaggeration to state that the blues underpins almost all modern music. Beyoncé, Kanye, Ed Sheeran: None of these artists would exist without it, and the musical ancestors of all three can be precisely traced back to the Deep South of the United States during the antebellum period.</p>
<p>But what exactly <i>is</i> the blues? We know it when we hear it, thanks to certain definable musical elements like chord progressions, yet arguments still exist as to the ancestry, lineage, and “true” nature of the genre. It&#8217;s an art form wrapped in myth and mythology, from the otherworldly provenance of Robert Johnson’s sublime gifts to Afro-Christian notions of evil and the poignant folklore found in the songs of Mississippi John Hurt. Yet this is part of the blues’ enduring appeal: Untangling the webs and uncovering truths, in a search for a genuine understanding of the history and origins of the blues, is almost a requirement for being a fan. Alongside hip-hop, reggae, and grime, this is music indelibly linked to the conditions from which it arose, an art form that also serves as social commentary, communal history, and cathartic release.</p>
<p>Blues songs speak of the joy and suffering of being alive. They also remind us of one of the darkest periods in human history, of the terrible depths to which we are capable of sinking should we abandon the notion that all people are equal in value. This is a message that, in all likelihood, will never cease to be relevant. A hundred years on from its birth, the blues continue to speak to the heart. The articles below collectively do a fine job of capturing the essence, meaning, history, and importance of this most singular sound.</p>
<h2><a href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2008/11/johnson200811?src=longreads"">Searching for Robert Johnson</a> (Frank Digiacomo, <i>Vanity Fair</i>, October 2008)</h2>
<p>Perhaps more than any other bluesman, Robert Leroy Johnson epitomizes the lasting allure and deep mythology of the genre. The legendary artist recorded just 29 tracks before dying at age 27, performing mostly in bars and on street corners across Mississippi in the 1930s. His physical presence feels as spectral as his music. Just two extant photos of the man exist, and very little firsthand information. Much of Johnson&#8217;s enduring fame centers on the perennial blues myth that the musician owed his guitar skills to the devil, to whom he traded his soul at a crossroads outside of Clarksdale. In fact, this particular tale predates Johnson, and has been attributed to many other bluesmen over the years, yet it sticks to Johnson like no other.</p>
<blockquote class=""sidenote""><p>A thorough deconstruction of the man and his music can be found in Elijah Wald&#8217;s excellent book, <a href=""https://www.elijahwald.com/rjohnson.html""><i>Escaping the Delta</i></a>, published by Harper Collins in 2004.</p></blockquote>
<p>Digiacomo’s feature explores the continuing fascination and mystery surrounding this singular artist, though it does so obliquely: The incredible and convoluted story begins one day in 2005, when Steven “Zeke” Schein, a guitar expert and Delta blues obsessive, stumbles upon what he believes to be a never-before-seen photograph of Johnson. The ensuing tale illustrates in compelling prose the intriguing intangibility of the musician&#8217;s life and work.</p>
<blockquote><p>With the eBay photo still on his computer monitor, Schein dug up his copy of the Johnson boxed set and took another look. Not only was he more confident than ever that he had found a photo of Robert Johnson, he had a hunch who the other man in the photo was, too: Johnny Shines, a respected Delta blues artist in his own right, and one of the handful of musicians who, in the early 1930s and again in the months before Johnson’s death, had traveled with him from town to town to look for gigs or stand on busy street corners and engage in a competitive practice known as “cuttin’ heads,” whereby one blues musician tries to draw away the crowd (and their money) gathered around another musician by standing on a nearby corner and outplaying him.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/feb/08/jackie-kay-on-bessie-smith-my-libidinous-raunchy-fearless-blueswoman?src=longreads"">Jackie Kay on Bessie Smith: &#8216;My Libidinous, Raunchy, Fearless Blueswoman&#8217;</a> (Jackie Kay, <i>The Guardian</i>, February 2021)</h2>
<p>Jacqueline &#8220;Jackie&#8221; Kay is a remarkable figure. A writer who holds both an MBE and CBE for services to literature, her many other achievements include winning the prestigious Somerset Maugham Award, the Guardian Fiction Prize, and becoming poet laureate of Scotland. All this despite the considerable challenges of her personal background.</p>
<p>In this moving piece, Kay talks fondly and with passion about the inspiration she found, as a gay Black girl growing up in 1970s Glasgow, in the life and music of blues singer Bessie Smith. Kay transports us back to her formative years, welcoming the reader inside the mind of her younger self to encounter the feelings, strengths, and flights of fantasy that sprang from her internal relationship with the legendary singer. Later, in 1997, Kay would publish her own critically acclaimed biography of the artist: <i>Bessie Smith: A Poet&#8217;s Biography of a Blues Legend</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>On the front cover she was smiling. Every feature of her face lit up by a huge grin bursting with personality. Her eyes full of hilarity. Her wide mouth full of laughing teeth. On the back she was sad. Her mouth shut. Eyes closed. Eyebrows furrowed. The album cover was like a strange two-sided coin. The two faces of Bessie Smith. I knew from that first album that I had made a friend for life. I would never forget her.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a href=""http://southwestreview.com/magazine/autumn-winter-2017/j-r-s-jook-and-the-authenticity-mirage/?src=longreads"">J. R.&#8217;s Jook and the Authenticity Mirage</a> (Greg Brownderville, <i>Southwest Review</i>, 2017)</h2>
<p>Musician and writer Greg Brownderville takes a literal step back into the mythical blues landscape in this evocative piece about friendship, music, and an almost-forgotten way of life, when a chance encounter leads him to a blues-jam party hosted by a character who lingers large in the author&#8217;s memory.</p>
<p>For many blues aficionados, nothing matters more than “authenticity,” whatever that nebulous term is taken to mean. This article discusses that, for sure, but the love and passion at the heart of this essay is to be discerned in thoughts about friendship, community, and the true warts-and-all history of a music that will forever be entangled with the socioeconomic conditions from which it arose.</p>
<blockquote><p>Pudding slung her arm around me and shouted, “J. R.! If this boy can blues, remember: I’m the one invited him. If he can’t blues, it’s all your fault for handing him this guitar.” J. R. howled a boisterous laugh. But then he said with a serious, almost-preacherly voice, “Listen. We tickled to have this young man here tonight. I believe we done found us a new friend in blues.”</p></blockquote>
<h2><a href=""https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/keeping-blues-alive-180960128/"">Keeping the Blues Alive</a> (Touré, <i>Smithsonian</i>, September 2016)</h2>
<p>The current state of the blues landscape continues to provoke arguments, introspection, and fears. Some would even contest that “real” blues is a thing of the past, its present-day protagonists serving up a distilled version of an art form forever frozen in time. Such conditions make this piece by renowned music critic Touré a fascinating read, as he documents a visit to the 32nd International Blues Challenge in Memphis, Tennessee.</p>
<blockquote class=""sidenote""><p>For an in-depth look at one of the most feted of current bluesmen, Christone &#8220;Kingfish&#8221; Ingram, see <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2022/07/20/kingfish-blues-buddy-guy-guitar/?src=longreads"">Carlo Rotella’s <i>Washington Post</i> profile</a> of the man and his craft.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Memphis in recent years has become home to a celebrated rap movement, Touré discovers a city in which the blues are very much alive and kicking. Fans will find much to celebrate and find themselves able to take a hatful of hope from this beautifully written piece, which covers blues from all angles, from the deeply personal to the highly pragmatic. To hear modern advocates speak with such passion, knowledge, and reverence is as inspirational as it is moving.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The blues is an antipsychotic to keep my people from losing their minds,” she begins. “It started with the moans and groans of agony, the slave roots of it all.” Then she sings, “There’s a man goin’ ’round takin’ names! There’s a man goin’ ’round takin’ names!” She shoots us a coldblooded look.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a href=""https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/clarksdale-what-the-delta-teaches-about-music-home-and-hope?src=longreads"">What the Mississippi Delta Teaches Me About Home—and Hope</a> (Wright Thompson, <i>National Geographic</i>, June 2020)</h2>
<p>Wright Thompson grew up in Clarksdale, a town in Mississippi that strongly asserts its claim as “the birthplace of the blues.” It certainly has a wealth of history to back this up: Muddy Waters, Ike Turner, Sam Cooke, and a host of other musicians were born there, and the town remains an enticing draw for modern blues fans.</p>
<p>I suspect that this article, in which Wright Thompson and his young family take a short trip through the Mississippi Delta, will resonate with many. COVID has changed some more than others, but for all of us, the world will never be quite the same. Here, Thompson explores how blues music — full of life, longing, hope, and pain — resonates across the decades. The blues frequently evoke suffering and heartbreak, but it should be remembered that it is, at its core, a purging, and in many ways a purifying force.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve been thinking recently about how these specific blues could be the soundtrack for a country trying to emerge from quarantine in one piece. A friend I trust told me that sentiment sounds like a kumbaya, and I know what he means. There is real pain and irreducible violence in the music. It records a very particular history.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a href=""https://lithub.com/when-young-elvis-met-the-legendary-b-b-king/?src=longreads"">When Young Elvis Met the Legendary B.B. King</a> (Daniel de Visé, <em>Lit Hub</em>, November 2021)</h2>
<p>Two “kings” meet here in this illuminating piece — an excerpt of de Visé’s book <i>King of the Blues: The Rise and Reign of B.B. King</i> — which does a fine job of capturing the magic and majesty of two stars from different sides of the blues line. Presley&#8217;s music and heritage is every bit as caught up in the blues as B.B.&#8217;s. To modern eyes and ears, the legacy of Elvis can seem problematic. For some it is a clear-cut case: Elvis stole Black music. The reality is far more nuanced. Presley was very much aware of his overwhelming debt to the blues, an art form he loved and admired above all others, and this piece offers a telling glimpse into the complicated and bigoted world of the music industry in ’50s/’60s America.</p>
<p>B.B. himself is one of the few &#8220;classic” bluesmen to have extended his professional work into the modern age. He began his career at the tail end of the ’40s, and played his final live show in 2014. A living link to the past and revered by countless musicians from the ’60s onwards, King remains one of the greatest exponents of electric blues. There is another vital link here: Producer Sam Phillips, the man who “discovered” Elvis, also produced many of King&#8217;s early recordings.</p>
<blockquote class=""sidenote""><p>Peter Guralnick&#8217;s <a href=""https://www.littlebrown.com/titles/peter-guralnick/sam-phillips-the-man-who-invented-rock-n-roll/9780316341844/""><em>Sam Phillips: The Man Who Invented Rock ’n’ Roll</em></a>, a wonderful history of Phillips, explores this theme in detail.</p></blockquote>
<p>You&#8217;ll find a striking line in this article in the form of a quote from Phillips: “If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars.” Whether Phillips truly said this is up for debate. Many have argued that if Phillips did say such a thing, it would have been in the spirit of frustration, and bemoaning such racism. This is a man who championed Black musicians long before — and long after — the coming of Elvis. Regardless, the sentiment lays bare the appalling racism that was endemic to the business at that time.</p>
<blockquote><p>“But Elvis was different. He was friendly. I remember Elvis distinctly,” B.B. recalled, “because he was handsome and quiet and polite to a fault”—not unlike B.B. himself. “Spoke with this thick molasses Southern accent and always called me ‘sir.’ I liked that. In the early days, I heard him strictly as a country singer,” which is how most people regarded Elvis in the early years. Elvis made his first television appearance on a program titled Louisiana Hayride. “I liked his voice, though I had no idea he was getting ready to conquer the world.”</p></blockquote>

http://longreads.com/rss,"What We Save, What We Destroy: A Reading List on Difficult Heritage","<p style=""text-align:center;""><em>By <a href=""https://twitter.com/bolinresearch"">Annalisa Bolin</a></em><b> </b></p>
<p>Years ago, during a stop in Phnom Penh while on a backpacking trip through Southeast Asia, I visited Tuol Sleng, a museum of the Cambodian genocide, and Choeung Ek, the killing fields. Both were places where thousands of victims of the Khmer Rouge had been murdered; now, tourists moved along their hallways and paths, mostly in silence. I still remember staring down at my toes in dusty sandals, stopped just short of the human bone fragments coming up through the dirt, as a guide held his hand out to keep me moving.</p>
<p>After leaving, I couldn’t stop thinking about my visit. The terrible history of what had happened at these sites haunted me, as did their material remains, but so did the troubling decision I made to be there at all. Why had I chosen to go to these places? It felt like a responsibility, in a way — to learn about the country I was traveling through, to pay my respects, clumsily, to the dead — but I was disturbed, too, by what I had done. Was I just a voyeur of other people’s pain?</p>
<p>Sites like these fall under the umbrella of what can be called difficult heritage: the places, artifacts, stories, and practices that we have inherited from the past, and use, in some fashion, today. We tangle our presents together with our pasts. As an American I know the stories we tell about our history as a nation, and the icons in which they are rooted: the Liberty Bell; the Mayflower; the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution that are<a href=""https://museum.archives.gov/founding-documents""> on display in the National Archives</a>. People often think of heritage as something they’re proud of, a unifying point around which to coalesce. But heritage comprises the horrible parts of history, too, the ones many would prefer to forget, or over which societies continue to come into conflict. In America, plantations and buildings still standing today, built by enslaved people, are part of our heritage; so are the sites of battles and the stolen lands that were part of the genocide against Native populations. And even more heritage has been lost through neglect and deliberate destruction, as Jill Lepore explains in a story below.</p>
<p>After that trip to Cambodia, I went on to study difficult heritage professionally as an archaeologist and anthropologist of Rwanda. I learned how Rwandans were using the remains of their terrible past — the genocide committed against the Tutsi population in 1994 — in memorials that served as sites of mourning but also places of memory and education (and, for that matter, tourism, just like the Cambodian ones). In a way, the next decade of my life was shaped by those questions to which I had no good answers. Not only the ones about what I was doing there as a tourist encountering mass atrocity, but even broader ones, too: What do we do now with heritage that raises questions about pain, suffering, and our human pasts as both victims and perpetrators? How do we make these decisions today, and who has the right to do so? What kinds of values and politics guide our choices?</p>
<p>Even purportedly straightforward and “unifying” heritage has its faultlines: The Declaration of Independence’s “We the People” can mean something quite different to the descendants of Americans who weren’t counted as fully human in 1776 than to the descendants of those who were. Once you start digging, as the pieces in this reading list do, you find difficult heritage all around you. Museums are full of art and artifacts taken by colonial and genocidal forces. Public monuments commemorate people whose legacies are often, to put it gently, conflicted. Even cultural practices that are today seen as cheerful or entertaining can mask darker pasts, like Sweden’s Easter witches, who bring something like Halloween to springtime.</p>
<p>As the global protests calling for the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/us/confederate-statues-photos.html"">removal of controversial statues and monuments</a> in recent years have shown, people care deeply about what we do with the objects and places that make up our heritage — what we save, and what we destroy. What we do with heritage reflects how we understand ourselves: who we were, who we are, and who we want to be.</p>

<p>Sites that memorialize tragedy and atrocity can be found all over the world, from Phnom Penh to Auschwitz to Rwanda, and these sites are visited by survivors, mourners, and tourists. The tension between paying respects and bearing witness, and exploiting or gawking, is unresolved; maybe it’s unresolvable. Steve Kandell’s essay about the opening of the 9/11 Memorial Museum in New York City is a raw personal account of confronting this tension. After his sister’s death in the Twin Towers, Kandell and his family did not participate in the development of the memorial museum; his story here recounts what happened when he decided to visit. His powerful, painful ambivalence about the memorial reminds us that even when history has been packaged up for public consumption, it also remains very present, personal, and agonizing for so many.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think now of every war memorial I ever yawned through on a class trip, how someone else&#8217;s past horror was my vacant diversion and maybe I learned something but I didn&#8217;t feel anything. Everyone should have a museum dedicated to the worst day of their life and be forced to attend it with a bunch of tourists from Denmark. Annotated divorce papers blown up and mounted, interactive exhibits detailing how your mom&#8217;s last round of chemo didn&#8217;t take, souvenir T-shirts emblazoned with your best friend&#8217;s last words before the car crash. And you should have to see for yourself how little your pain matters to a family of five who need to get some food before the kids melt down. Or maybe worse, watch it be co-opted by people who want, for whatever reason, to feel that connection so acutely.</p></blockquote>

<p>In spring, the historic core of Karlskrona, a city on Sweden’s southern coast, was decorated for Easter. Multicolored feathers were tied to bushes and, if I’d been there at the right time, a colleague told me, I could’ve seen little girls walking around in long, flowing clothes, with round red spots of makeup on their cheeks. “They’re the Easter witches!” she explained. “We used to love dressing up like that when we were kids.” I’d never heard of an Easter witch, so I pressed her. “Like Halloween!” she offered, adding that with the importation of that holiday from the U.S., Swedish children now have two run-around-town-demanding-candy festivals per year.</p>

<p>The Easter witches are called “påskkärringar,” and in this piece, Jennie Tiderman-Österberg traces the history of Swedish witches — or, rather, the country’s history of accusations of witchcraft, which resulted in the brutal deaths of a horrifying number of people (almost entirely women), particularly in the late 17th-century period called the Great Noise. The påskkärringar of today are charmingly attired kids who wear headscarves and carry baskets, but they owe their existence to a dark and terrible past. Tiderman-Österberg takes aim at a tradition that has neatly defanged itself, and asks us to consider the ways we transform, and even domesticate, pasts replete with suffering and pain.</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, what do we do with this dark and difficult part of our history that caused so much suffering? How do we manage the memories of such ordeals?</p>
<p>In Sweden, we meet the suffering by basically playing around with the Easter Hag. Since the 1800s, she is the tradition. She has become our heritage, not the events which lie hidden in her background. Do Swedes do this to cope with a difficult recollection? Or to reminisce over the times before the witch trials when spells were not an evil act and the cunning women of the forest an important part of our healthcare system? Or do we dress our children as witches because we prefer to make quaint a wildness we still secretly fear?</p></blockquote>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">When the news broke several months ago that the Smithsonian </span><a href=""https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/the-smithsonians-return-of-the-benin-bronzes-comes-after-years-of-relationship-building-180979716/""><span style=""font-weight:400;"">planned to return its collection of Benin Bronzes</span></a><span style=""font-weight:400;"">, it was met with relief from the Nigerian claimants — and surprise from observers who thought major Western museums would continue to fight tooth and nail to retain every item in their collections. These stunning bronze figures had been looted from the Kingdom of Benin by attacking British forces in the late 19th century, and they have been held in Western museums and private collections ever since. Requests for their return have mainly fallen upon deaf ears, as cultural institutions assert that returns would devastate their collections, or that the objects could not be adequately cared for elsewhere. Still, the Smithsonian’s change of position is not unique: Perhaps reflecting the start of a reckoning with colonial histories, recent years have seen an increasing number of returns, even as the total amount remains small.</span></p>

<p>In this piece, Tarisai Ngangura takes us through those requests. The article focuses on Africa, a continent whose cultural heritage has been stolen in massive quantities for the benefit of museums and collectors elsewhere. Ngangura considers what is lost when heritage is taken away; what claimants want returned (and how they hope to use what is returned); and how the beneficiaries of these collections — especially Western museums that have charged admission fees and built reputations on the backs of items gathered by colonial forces — have fought change. Whether museums in the Western world as we know them will exist in precisely the same form after such a reckoning is an open question. But if our status quo is dependent on ignoring how those museum collections came to be, that’s hardly a bad thing.</p>

Take your art and your belongings to their country,” said Nana Oforiatta Ayim, curator, filmmaker, and author of <i>The Godchild</i>. “Then they showcase them like, look what I have. I am more powerful than you. Years later, when the world has somewhat righted itself, you ask for them back and they refuse.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Like the Benin Bronzes, human remains are subject to repatriation claims. Bodies populate museum exhibitions around the world, from Egyptian mummies to those pulled from Europe&#8217;s peat bogs, and they serve as the subjects of scientific research, like the bones that are the focus of this story by Lizzie Wade. The Penn Museum’s Morton collection, an assemblage of human skulls, is named after the scientist Samuel Morton, who used cranial measurements to support his ideas about racial hierarchy and race “science.” Like many other institutions, the Morton collection accumulated its human remains in a process laced with structural violence, targeting those who had less power to prevent their bones from being collected: Black people, Indigenous communities, the enslaved. Over time, physical and biological anthropologists have tried to use new research approaches to reckon with their discipline’s former efforts to prove white supremacy through bone. Still, <i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">using </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">the collection differently doesn’t solve the essential problem: Can museums still hold and study human remains when their owners didn’t give consent? And what should we do with those collections, like the Morton, whose origins are saturated with racism?</span></p>
<blockquote><p>After the murder of George Floyd in May 2020 sparked protests for racial justice around the country, more and more people within and outside Penn began to see the Morton collection as a present-day perpetuation of racism and its harms, rather than just a historic example. Until last summer, most researchers thought &#8220;the science is justified because we&#8217;re doing it thoughtfully. And this moment brought to bear, no, that&#8217;s not enough,&#8221; says Rachel Watkins, a Black biological anthropologist at American University.</p>
<p>Even with recent research that strove to be respectful, it was almost always scientists who decided how and why to study the skulls, not their descendant communities, Athreya notes. &#8220;We were speaking for people without them at the table,&#8221; she says. To move forward ethically, &#8220;Those of us in power are going to have to give up some.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In this piece, Jill Lepore traces attempts to save Black American heritage in the form of burial grounds and human remains. But these efforts are also faced with challenges: Who, for example, gets to make the decisions? (It’s a question Wade also touches on in her story about the Morton skull collection.) As Howard University professor Fatimah Jackson asks, referring to another actor in these debates: “Does he speak for Black America? Or do I speak for Black America?”</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Examining the idea of “descendant communities” and the work of descendants, activists, scholars, and archaeologists, Lepore carefully untangles the complicated sociopolitics involved in trying to treat Black heritage, and Black communities, with the respect and dignity they have long been denied in the American public sphere.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>It isn’t merely an academic dispute. The proposed burial-grounds network and graves-protection acts are parts of a larger public deliberation, less the always elusive “national conversation” than a quieter collective act of conscientious mourning, expressed, too, in new monuments and museum exhibits. History gets written down in books but, like archeology, it can seep up from the earth itself, from a loamy underground of sacred, ancient things: gravestones tucked under elms and tangled by vines; iron-nailed coffins trapped beneath pavement and parking lots and highway overpasses. How and whether the debates over human remains get resolved holds consequences not only for how Americans understand the country’s past but also for how they picture its future. The dispute itself, along the razor’s edge between archeology and history, is beset by a horrible irony. Enslavement and segregation denied people property and ancestry. But much here appears to turn on inheritance and title: Who owns these graveyards? Who owns these bones? Who owns, and what is owed?</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Benjamin Wofford | WIRED | July 14th, 2022 | 5,000 words</em></p>
<p>A business feature that doubles as a horror story, Benjamin Wofford’s chilling piece could be the premise for a <em>Black Mirror</em> episode. Wofford profiles Urban Legend, a tech startup that has built “the Exchange,” an interface connecting advertisers looking to promote political ideologies with influencers ready to peddle for a price. Urban Legend’s CEO, Ory Rinat, who previously worked in the Trump White House, and his colleagues like to talk about trust, authenticity, and empowerment, but as Wofford skillfully shows, there’s no heart to their business model — there’s only a black hole, a moral vacuum. The dread of it all crept up on me as I read, which is a testament to the writing. Now excuse me while I go scream into the abyss. —<a href=""https://twitter.com/seywarddarby"" rel=""nofollow ugc"">SD</a></p>

<p><em>Josh Dzieza | The Verge | July 20th, 2022 | 5,091 words</em></p>
<p>Could artificial intelligence help you write your next novel? Josh Dzieza dives into the world of <span class=""p2-glossary-item"">AI</span>-assisted genre fiction, and how independent authors are experimenting with tools powered by GPT-3 to write stories faster. Dzieza recounts Kindle novelist Jennifer Lepp’s experience with one such tool, Sudowrite, which, at first, generates strange and hilarious output. Eventually, as Lepp learns how to control the software’s quirks, she gets results that are more promising. But they are unsettling, too: When Lepp gives a finished chapter to her husband to read, he isn’t able to distinguish between her voice and the machine’s. Dzieza also talks with authors who view AI as a welcome disruption to the field, such as Joanna Penn, who envisions a future where writers will be left behind if they don’t embrace the technology. This is a fascinating read that explores ethics, creativity, and authorship, and is a complement to the stories in our <a href=""https://longreads.com/2021/09/21/artificial-intelligence-language-model-machine-learning-open-ai-reading-list"" rel=""nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer"" aria-expanded=""false"">reading list on the future of machine-written prose</a>.

These aren’t just phallic manifestations of mind-boggling wealth.

(I love the bit where Yong compares his dog going on a walk to sniff and pee on things as the pup’s version of checking his social media for the day.) As you’d expect, their dialogue is delightful and accessible, thanks to Wong’s ability to open people’s eyes to experiences that are not their own and Yong’s knack for explaining scientific and biological concepts in plain language.

<p>This list is so damn fun. Starting in 431 B.C. and progressing chronologically, it levels the cultural playing field, quoting passages from <em>Beowulf</em> and <em>Macbeth</em> while also reveling in the transgressive lyrics of “Goodbye Earl.” It reminded me of at least one brilliant cinematic death that I’d somehow forgotten — before using an inhaler, make sure it’s not a gun! — and made me tear up at its description of a groundbreaking storyline in <em>Doonesbury</em>. Like all the best GOAT lists, it also made me consider what I would include: one of the gruesome deaths in <em>The Omen</em>, Mr. Jingles’ demise and resurrection in <em>The Green Mile</em>, Alec’s murder in <em>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</em> (ooooh — or the raising of the black flag at the end!?). “We’ve made this list during a pandemic, as real-life death has stalked us all, more tangible than ever,” Dan Kois writes. “One of the many things art can do is to help us navigate the pitfalls of life, and there’s no deeper pitfall than the final one.” —<a href=""https://twitter.com/seywarddarby"">SD</a></p>

http://longreads.com/rss,The Fact-Check and the Fury: A Chat With the Writers and Editor Behind The Atavist‘s New Issue,"<p><i>As host of </i><a href=""http://brendanomeara.com/"">The Creative Nonfiction Podcast</a><i>, Brendan O’Meara is no stranger to talking about the art and craft of storytelling. In this craft-focused excerpt, we’re digging into Episode 323, in which he interviewed </i>Atavist<i> editor Jonah Ogles and writers Leigh Baldwin and Sean Williams about their work on the latest issue of </i>The Atavist<i>.</i></p>
<p>Leigh Baldwin lives in London. Sean Williams lives in Berlin. Together, they co-wrote the latest issue of <i>The Atavist</i> with “<a href=""https://magazine.atavist.com/follow-the-leader-nazi-putin-sonntag-cold-war/"">Follow the Leader</a>,” a piece about Rainer Sonntag, who helped fuel a neo-Nazi movement that still plagues Germany to this day. Sonntag also was a Communist spy, and you may be familiar with the young KGB upstart he reported to: a man named Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>It would be a challenging story to tackle for a single reporter, but <i>two</i> reporters come with their own challenges. Did there ever come a point when there were too many cooks in the kitchen? How did they keep it all straight?</p>
<p>“Did we keep things straight and easy, Leigh?” asked Sean. “I&#8217;m not sure we managed to do it so well. But we tried.”</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re moving pieces of information around, trying to contract them into a coherent narrative — and then it&#8217;s really hard to keep track of footnotes, references, cross-references,” Leigh replied. “However well you try to keep track of it as you go along, there&#8217;s always a fairly horrible process at the end, where you&#8217;re racking your brains thinking, <i>I know I read this somewhere. But where did I get this from?</i> Or <i>which interview did this fact come from?</i>”<i> </i></p>
<p>Jonah Ogles, the lead editor for this piece, spoke about fact-checking — that “fairly horrible process at the end” — and how writers can make that process far more seamless for the editor and researcher who are ensuring the piece is airtight and ready for publication. The key, he said in no uncertain terms, is annotation. Not only does it make the writer’s work more organized during the writing process, but it gives the fact-checker the best possible resources to work from.</p>
<p>For those looking to do ambitious reporting and collaborative journalism, Jonah, Leigh, and Sean give you tremendous insights into what it takes — and how they pulled off this heavyweight of a feature. Please enjoy this excerpt below, and listen to <a href=""http://brendanomeara.com/leigh-baldwin-sean-williams-the-atavist-follow-the-leader/"">the full episode</a> for more.</p>
<p><i>These interviews have been edited for clarity and concision.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align:center;"">* * *</p>
<p><b>Brendan O&#8217;Meara: </b><b>There&#8217;s a lot going on in this story, Jonah.</b></p>
<p><b>Jonah Ogles: </b>This was one of those pitches that checked every box: It had twists and turns, and a sadly timely hook to it, which is rare for us. Leigh and Sean had the goods when it came to source material — this unbelievable story that almost no one has heard of.</p>
<p><b> </b><b>There were two timely elements to it. There&#8217;s the craven ambition of Putin, but also this idea of how far-right extremism, as much as you want to believe that it&#8217;s gone, is very much prevalent. Even though this takes place in Germany, we&#8217;re seeing it here in the United States, and I felt that pulse throughout this whole piece.</b></p>
<p>You could set this in various places in history, various points in time, where, yeah, all of these factors sort of come together to create the right conditions for, you know, for people with this really hateful ideology to basically exploit the conditions for their own personal gratification and, you know, glory — it&#8217;s a dark piece.</p>
<p><b>What becomes the challenge on your end when you&#8217;re working with two reporters?</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a different thing. This isn’t the first dual byline piece that I&#8217;ve worked on. It&#8217;s a little bit harder, I think, because they’re each bringing a different thing to the story; one person may be better versed in the documents and the other person might have a little more experience writing deep scenery of the type that we like. It requires more patience, and more back-and-forth between all parties to make sure everything is coming together. It also means that there&#8217;s another person with their own schedule, their own timing. So, in my experience, these pieces tend to move along a little bit more slowly than other pieces. But the benefit is that you have three sets of eyes looking at it — finding weaknesses, trying to push it forward.</p>
<p><b>What&#8217;s the process by which you really started to hammer it home? “Okay, this is how we&#8217;re gonna start tying these threads together in a better way so we can stick the landing.”</b></p>
<p>When I was at <i>Outside</i>, I was a fact-checker on a handful of stories that had two writers. And, we would reach a point where the easy thing to slip into as a writer can be like, “Oh, well, that&#8217;s Jonah&#8217;s thing to deal with over there, and so what do I care if he&#8217;s not doing it on time?” But <i>somebody</i> has to care that it&#8217;s getting done on time. I would guess that stories with two bylines end up being stories where the editor has to take a larger role in getting things done, and making sure that the writers aren’t just waiting for the other one to do something. To Sean and Leigh&#8217;s credit, they were always really responsive, and communication was about as seamless as it can be with two writers working on something. I assumed they were buddies, but it turns out they were in different countries — and I never would have known because they were really on top of answering emails and hitting deadlines.</p>
<p><b>What can reporters do on a story of this nature to make the fact-checking easier if they’re not well-versed in helping that side of the table?</b></p>
<p>This is a great question, and the answer is actually really easy: It&#8217;s just annotation. As thorough an annotation as you can give them. If you have a transcript, and there&#8217;s a quote, just go ahead and put the minute and second timestamp in there. If you’re quoting from a book, put the page number in there. You&#8217;re less likely to make mistakes as a writer when you do that. I&#8217;ve had stories that have just fallen apart in fact-check, but then I&#8217;ve had stories that just sailed through — and the ones that sailed through was because it&#8217;s annotated. As the writer was annotating, they just kept double-checking themselves: Oops, I got this quote a little bit wrong; or oh, hey, that&#8217;s not what this says. It just makes a fact-checker’s life so much easier. [Sean and Leigh] did a pretty good job of that, because they had a lot of source material — hundreds of pages of historical documents.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have an annotated draft, a fact-checker is sitting there reading hundreds of pages of documents. When I was a fact-checker, I would have to read through everything just to get familiar with it, and then read it all again in order to find the actual material that I was looking for. So when you annotate, you remove that from the equation — you give that checker the ability to make sure that you got the right facts from the source material. But it also gives them time to step back and look into other stuff, look into sources that maybe the writer <i>didn&#8217;t</i> refer to in their reporting, and say, “Hey, are we characterizing the rise of neo-Nazism in West Germany properly?” When you have a fact-checker who has the time and energy to do that extra legwork for a piece, that will only make a piece better.<b></b></p>

<p><b>And at the very end, when you&#8217;re ready to send it to the press, as it were, that&#8217;s when you can remove all the annotation, so it becomes reader-friendly. </b></p>
<p>Exactly. From a reader standpoint, this isn&#8217;t an academic journal, though it’s sort of sourced like one. This is a true story, but we want it to be immersive and to suck readers in, and 200 footnotes probably get in the way of that.<b></b></p>
<p><b>Years ago, I used to admire the footnotes of David Foster Wallace or Chuck Klosterman. Over the years, though, if I see a footnote, I&#8217;m like, “Oh, God, if it&#8217;s not good enough to be in the main body of text, I don&#8217;t care what funny aside you think is happening, it takes me totally out of the piece.” I hate them now.</b><b></b></p>
<p>Chris Keyes at <i>Outside </i>once gave me a note on a story I was editing. He was like, “Parentheses are a signal to me that the writer and editor haven&#8217;t figured out where to put this piece of information yet.” I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a hard and fast truth; sometimes it&#8217;s impossible to avoid. But it&#8217;s a really good practice for me as an editor to identify a footnote or a parenthetical and say, “Okay, here&#8217;s the thing that isn&#8217;t contained within the flow of the story. How do I get it in the flow of the story?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>Why don&#8217;t we start off by you both giving me a sense of how you arrived at this story?</b><b></b></p>
<p><b>Leigh Baldwin: </b>I run a small nonprofit newsroom in London called Source Material. And well, just rooting around looking at things, I came across an old story from 2015 by a German outlet about Putin&#8217;s early years when he was a KGB officer in Dresden in East Germany. There were a couple of lines in the piece buried a long way down, about the fact that one of the agents he recruited — or was recruited on his behalf — was a neo-Nazi called Rainer Sonntag. No one else seemed to have really noticed because it was a long piece, focusing mostly on other aspects of Putin&#8217;s life, which were also very interesting. <b></b></p>
<p>When I mentioned it to people, no one seemed to know. So I became slightly obsessed, [but] didn&#8217;t have the opportunity to do anything until I got to go to Dresden and spend a few days in the city archives, digging through all the court records from the case surrounding Sonntag&#8217;s eventual shooting in 1991. And what I stumbled upon was a mine of massive forensic detail. So we could reconstruct, second by second almost, the moments of his death. There were forensic photos of his body, there were witness statements from all angles of the scene. And there was a wealth of background material. So the next step was to get the Stasi archives; that whole process took six months. By that time, we were deep into the pandemic and other things were getting in the way, and I put the story on the back burner. And then Source Material did a story for a news organization called Tortoise in London, and it happened that Sean did a story for them about East German neo-Nazis. I thought, wow, this could be the perfect person to help this story finally make it.<b></b></p>
<p><b>Sean Williams:</b> I’d also done a story for <i>GQ</i> the summer before about [Germany’s COVID] protests, and it was kind of a crazy situation. I was thinking, “Maybe I could do something a little nicer about Germany for once.” But then Leigh called me in and I thought, “Why not? Let&#8217;s just jump into neo-Nazism again, that can be a beat for a while.” <b></b></p>
<p><b>For journalists like you who have covered extremism and hate groups, how is it that you don&#8217;t get pulled into the mud?</b></p>
<p><b>Williams: </b>You have to kind of see the progress that&#8217;s been made, in some ways. The story that we did for <i>The Atavist</i> shows that this was something that was being manipulated by different forces all through the Cold War. But now it&#8217;s a different matter. There is a far right [in Germany], of course — we&#8217;ve spoken to many members of its scene — but it&#8217;s small. And I think we&#8217;re making progress. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;d like to believe we&#8217;re on an upward trajectory. I mean, we can&#8217;t get any worse than back in those days. Some very general sense of things getting better; that&#8217;ll keep me going.</p>
<p><b>Baldwin: </b>For me, there was a sense that the characters were so fascinating. You have Rainer Sonntag; when you see footage or photos of him, he&#8217;s always got this slight smirk on his face. Even when he&#8217;s trying to give a really serious Nazi propaganda speech, he can&#8217;t stop breaking out into laughter. And so all these characters are a massive contradiction. The main Nazi leader in West Germany to whom Sonntag attached himself, Michael Kühnen, came out as gay in 1986. That split the neo-Nazi movement in West Germany down the middle, and suddenly it was divided into — well, almost the gay Nazis and the straight Nazis, the ones who supported Kühnen and still and the ones who didn&#8217;t. All these microcosms of strange politics were really, really fascinating. And I think those storylines keep you focused rather than being dragged down into a swamp of misery and pessimism.</p>
<p><b>Leigh, you said something earlier about stumbling on a few lines buried in a piece; so often, these longform stories come from people who notice a cast-off line in something else and realize there’s more there. Where do you go about panning for gold and finding ideas?</b></p>
<p><b>Williams: </b>A lot of buried ledes. There&#8217;s loads of stories like the one that kicked this one off, with mad little details buried in the middle. You&#8217;re gonna pick up tons and tons of information just by reading random snippets on any kind of topic. There&#8217;s another story that I&#8217;m doing for <i>Outside</i> right now, and it came from just watching a 10-minute YouTube video of a guy [being interviewed], and noticing that this was an interesting character.</p>
<p><b>Baldwin: </b>When you stumble across one of these little nuggets, you sort of go through an informal testing process of bouncing it off people and seeing what they think. For me, the key test was telling colleagues in London, saying, “Did you know Putin recruited a neo-Nazi agent?” and they say, “Wow.” But the real test that we passed, I think, was when I told German journalists — people who are really steeped in German history and politics — and it still was jaw-dropping to them. Most people in Germany had no idea about this. And the fact that it had shock value and was so fascinating not just to people outside Germany, but to Germans, too, really gave me the idea that this was something worth pursuing.</p>
<p><b>When your reporting hits dead ends and there&#8217;s a lot to comb through, how do you keep persevering to find more of those things that are going to nourish the piece?</b></p>
<p><b>Williams: </b>It&#8217;s keeping things clear at all times. Not just in the sense that you have a clear direction of what you want a story to be, but literally physically keeping all of your notes as clear and as well-ordered as possible. We were counting up the number of Stasi files that we went through in this piece, and it&#8217;s in the high hundreds, including all the court docs — and they&#8217;re all in very officious German. We spent a whole week together in Berlin sitting in an Airbnb and going over them.<b> </b></p>
<p>When you have that much information, and there are all these dozens and dozens of potential witnesses and contacts, if you&#8217;ve got a bunch of garbled notes, or don’t have everything streamlined as much as you can, you&#8217;re dead in the water. It was tough enough as it was, because there were a few people that led nowhere. I went down to Langen, which is one of the main places that the Nazis tried to establish themselves in the ’80s, and knocked on a bunch of doors before I found someone who was a former leader of the movement there — and got told in no uncertain terms to go away.</p>
<p>That was just one of a few trips that led nowhere, but it all builds a clearer picture of where you want to focus your attention. In the end, we realized that there are a few protagonists that we really wanted to zero in on — Klaus [Zuchold, who worked with Putin to recruit agents] being the main example. Obviously, the story was always going to be about Sonntag and Putin and Kühnen, the other leader of the Nazi movement at the time. But there are a few other guys that sort of cropped up that I didn&#8217;t expect to speak to. And they turned out to be pretty amazing sources.</p>
<p><b>In the piece, you mentioned how, even in the ’80s, Putin was working to add upheaval in the West — and then even today in France and elsewhere, including the cybertactics that certainly affected elections in the United States. Where did he develop this playbook of disruption?</b></p>
<p><b>Baldwin: </b>I think it&#8217;s extreme pragmatism. If you go back to the ’60s, the Communist spy agencies — the KGB and the Stasi in East Germany — had a history of stoking far-right movements and Nazism. Spraying graffiti on Jewish gravestones, for example. By the time it gets to the ’80s, the East Germans are more worried about Western neo-Nazism spreading east because it was a protest movement against the Communist regime. So they were probably less trying to stir up trouble in the East with Sonntag than using him to keep an eye on that. But the interesting thing is that they have no moral compunction about dealing with and instrumentalizing neo-Nazis. It has to be said, too, that West German intelligence services also had a lot of agents that were Nazis, and right up to the modern day had a very complicated and controversial history. So there&#8217;s pragmatism on both sides, but I think you can see that that&#8217;s the common thread that really links the Putin policy of then to the Putin policy today.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Williams: </b>I was speaking to Anton Shekhovtsov today, an academic who&#8217;s written about Russia on the far right. He said that Putin wasn&#8217;t really an ideological Communist at all, but he was a statist. Everything was done in service to the Soviet empire, later the Russian state. And now he runs the country like a king. His sowing of chaos all over the West is to destabilize them, because Russia is not a very strong force economically, in many respects. You have to use this asymmetrical warfare to get over on your enemies — and if that means employing neo-Nazis and fascists to cause trouble wherever you want them to do so, then that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re going to do.</p>
<p><b>Given the state of journalism, and reporters often being often maligned — in the States, we hear people calling them “enemy of the people” — where is the juice for the two of you in keeping that flame alive with hard investigative work?</b></p>
<p><b>Baldwin: </b>To go back to the earlier question about how to write about Nazis without being sucked in and getting miserable: One of the things about Putin&#8217;s policy now is that he very much enjoys playing the extremes in the democratic West against each other. Writing about Nazis and understanding them as an actor — not taking a side in the culture war, which has Putin laughing all the way to the Kremlin, but as journalism — is part of the democratic role. We don&#8217;t try and condemn people who voted for Trump or neo-Nazis or Brexiteers, but we try to understand them and see what makes them tick.</p>
<p><b>Williams: </b>There&#8217;s so much disinformation pouring into people&#8217;s ears and eyes at the moment with regards to Ukraine. And I think that Russia has done a pretty decent job of muddying the waters. In Germany right now, the conversation is not about Russia pounding shopping malls and killing civilians, but about whether [Ukrainian nationalist] Stepan Bendera is a historical far-right fascist figure, and if that should make us think twice about supporting Ukrainians today. I hope that good journalism can sift through. If we can add to the conversation, and you can see straight-up that Putin has been funding the far right as far back as when he was a KGB officer, then that&#8217;s really all we can do.</p>
<p><b>How can consumers of news be more literate when it comes to credible information versus what isn&#8217;t?</b></p>
<p><b>Williams:</b> Good question. Maybe switching off the TV and reading stuff will be a good start. If you read a few good sources of newspapers and magazines, if not just for the fact that you have to interact with it. Whereas with TV, you can sit back with your mouth open and take in the information. And you can certainly just scroll until you&#8217;re half-dead on Twitter.</p>
<p><b>Baldwin: </b>Journalism is a loser&#8217;s game; we&#8217;re never going to win the battle. It&#8217;s almost like catching drug cheats in sport — the cheats are always a couple of years ahead of the enforcement authorities. All we can do is keep banging away. I don&#8217;t think the traditional model of journalism is broken. I think we need to just stick to that plodding, sometimes prosaic pursuit of the facts.</p>
<p><b>Williams: </b>Stories have always engaged people more than anything else. And that&#8217;s why so much fake news has been effective at bypassing people&#8217;s credulity. I hope that stories like this, something longer, something a bit narrative with a protagonist that people can identify with or understand a little better, can help people connect.</p>
<p>When I was talking with Jonah yesterday, we got to talking about the nature of fact-checking and how to just keep track of everything and make sure that everything&#8217;s well annotated — for yourselves and for the fact-checker as well. When you&#8217;re collaborating on a piece of this nature, how are you keeping things straight and making sure that everything is attributable?</p>
<p><b>Williams: </b>Did we keep things straight and easy, Leigh? I&#8217;m not sure we managed to do it so well. But we tried.</p>
<p><b>Baldwin: </b>The honest answer is I&#8217;ve been doing investigations for a very long time now. You&#8217;re moving pieces of information around, trying to contract them into a coherent narrative — and then it&#8217;s really hard to keep track of footnotes, references, cross-references. However well you try to keep track of it as you go along, there&#8217;s always a fairly horrible process at the end, where you&#8217;re racking your brains thinking, <i>I know I read this somewhere. But where did I get this from?</i> Or <i>which interview did this fact come from? </i>For example, we have the Stasi files. They&#8217;re all scans; you can&#8217;t find the words in them with Ctrl-F, because they&#8217;re not easily machine-readable. So you just have to hunt through these hundreds of pages until you find the obscure fact that you&#8217;re looking for. And the fact process was extremely time-consuming. But I found over the years that there aren&#8217;t really any shortcuts for that type of thing.</p>
<p><b>Williams: </b>It&#8217;s sort of a double-edged sword when you&#8217;re working as a pair, right? Because in one way you can divvy up the work; you can take your own turf, and trust the other guy that they&#8217;re going to know what they&#8217;re doing. But when it comes to the fact-check, and you&#8217;re cross-referencing things that one of you or the other might have found, it can tie you in knots. In some cases, certainly, there were certainly parts of the story that I sort of took over. And there were parts of the story that Leigh had complete control over. And when it came to putting everything together, it worked really well in pretty much every way. But when it comes to that back end, and putting all the notes into the coherent spots, and making sure everything&#8217;s clear, that can become an extra challenge.</p>
<p><b>That segues beautifully into one of the last things I want to talk about with you: the nature of collaboration on a story of this nature, which is so, so big. It&#8217;s undoubtedly a challenge when you&#8217;re composing because everyone has their own writing style, but in the end, you need something cohesive. How did you riff off of each other, and how did you create a common vision?</b></p>
<p><b>Baldwin: </b>What was apparent from the outset is that Sean and I had a very similar vision of what we wanted to do. We saw a story that was full of wonderful narratives, wonderful drama, and incredible forensic detail of Sonntag&#8217;s death. We also had years and years of Stasi documents where the secret police were invading every aspect of his life: sending agents to hang around in the corridor outside his house, spying on him when he&#8217;s drinking in the pub, getting his school reports and his teachers, talking to his colleagues.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I found that harder than writing about the Nazis. When you first get your hands on these Stasi documents, you sort of feel like Howard Carter blowing the dust off the sarcophagus and you dive in. But very quickly, you become aware of how banal it is and how invasive it is. I found it quite uncomfortable having this voyeuristic position, into all the private, most private banal details of someone&#8217;s life. But what we had from those documents was this very compelling narrative. And I think we both very quickly had the same vision of how we wanted it to go.</p>
<p><b>Williams: </b>Another thing about working as a pair: It made interviews with some of these ex-officials and spies a human experience. Double-team interviewing a former Stasi agent in a Greek restaurant outside of a German city while drinking beer and Schnapps? That&#8217;s a good, fun journalistic experience. I guess we were lucky because we hadn&#8217;t worked on a piece before, and it came together really nicely. I think that we were able to really find our own individual place within this pairing that we had.</p>
<p><b>I always like to ask for a recommendation of some kind, and the bonus of this one is that we get to get two from each of you guys. Sean, we can start with you — what might you recommend out there for the listeners, professional or personal or whatever?</b></p>
<p><b> </b><b>Williams: </b>Through doing this reporting on Cold War Germany, I got obsessed for quite a while with Len Deighton novels, and was pressing to stick these really cheesy Len Deighton-ish lines into the story as if we were writing <i>Berlin Game</i> or one of his other novels. So I would say anyone wanting to have fun with an incredibly witty spy novel, you should read Len Deighton.</p>
<p>And secondly, with this and other recent projects that I&#8217;ve done, I’ve found that I’m increasingly relying on listening to my stories — getting a friend or my long-suffering partner to record herself reading the story, so I can take the dog for a walk and listen to that. I find that that&#8217;s a lot easier for picking apart structure. I don&#8217;t know how good those text-to-speech programs are, but they certainly aren&#8217;t as good as a friend of yours. So, yeah, that&#8217;s my recommendation. <b> </b></p>
<p><b>Baldwin: </b>A lot of my research was punctuated by the soundtrack of Germany in the 1980s. There was also a wonderful book that I read quite late in the reporting process, but we quoted in the piece: <i>Stasiland</i> by Anna Funder, an Australian journalist who spent a lot of time in the former East Germany after the fall of the [Berlin] Wall. It&#8217;s a book about the Stasi, but through the eyes of ordinary people, and about their experience of living under the most oppressive surveillance regime that ever existed.</p>
<p><b>Williams: </b>If we can get people listening to German New Wave stuff from the ’80s after this project, then that’s a win, because that stuff is awesome.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">For each year that I move around the sun, my sister ages seven times as much. The odds are in my favor that even though we grew up together, I will experience her tail end before mine ever comes. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">It was a Saturday in June, one year ago, when I got the news. My partner and I were living in Bakoven, a spot in Cape Town at the confluence of mountains and ocean. In the mornings, sunlight would sift in through our front windows, mirroring the milky gold of the Atlantic, while fog from Table Mountain foamed against our back doors. Our home stood so steadfast amid the dramas of the surrounding landscape, so unassuming, it occurred to me it looked like a storybook portal between worlds — wrapped in bliss, buffered from trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Stepping out of my morning shower and into a cloud of hot condensation that day, I was struck by how Florian stood awkwardly in the middle of the room, regarding me with pause. He pressed me into a chair like I was porcelain, and I watched the movement of his lips as he relayed a message from my family in Singapore: Shandi has cancer. Hemangiosarcoma. She has one or two months more.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">I remember only how he held his breath, waiting for me to say something. I told him I had to go. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:center;""><span style=""font-weight:400;"">***</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The story of my sister and I began in Singapore, in September, 14 years ago. My father had left home for a lady he’d been secretly keeping, and my mother was single-minded about finding a pet to plug the hole he’d left. Let’s call him Albert, or Swarna, she had said, planning for a male dog to take one of my father’s names.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">We went to a dilapidated white shack on the outskirts of town to look for my father’s replacement. It was overrun with animals: creatures trampling over each other, tossing and tumbling, making sounds like feral pigs. To the side, a single golden ball of fur sat up and looked at us, quiet and alone, bright and sweet as a sunflower. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">She was the runt of the litter, separated from her siblings because they had stepped on her, bitten her, and eaten all her food, we were told by the farm owner. Moved by her circumstance — perhaps because we likened it to our own sense of being downtrodden at that time — we decided to take her home. We named her Shandi in the end, after a <span class=""h-small-caps"">Jolly Shandy</span> advertisement on a bus that passed us on the way. We changed the “y” to an “i” for cuteness. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Shandi and I belonged to each other from then on. My years in Singapore coalesced around her. She was the one safe thing I knew. We slept on the same bed, ate the same food, and lived with the same stomping, screaming, tired woman who made rules for how we were to behave and punished us when we broke them. Around us, a carousel of maids flitted in and out, like moths to a flame. The woman who regarded herself as our mother is my biological mother. My sister&#8217;s true heritage is more of a mystery: All I knew was that she hailed from Australia. Later, a DNA test let me know that she’s a quarter Labrador, three quarters golden retriever.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">When I received her prognosis that day in South Africa, it would take me 19 hours on a plane, and a three-week quarantine in a hotel before I would be able to see her again. I worried I would not make it in time, and when I imagined a world where she was no longer, I wet Florian’s lap with tears. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Let’s write her a message in a bottle, he said, as he stroked my hair. Tell her you’ll be there for her. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Florian shepherded me out of the house and into his car so he could drive us down Chapman’s Peak, a classic scenic route in Cape Town. </span><span style=""font-weight:400;"">We stopped to pick up one glass bottle, one pink card, and one set of colorful markers. In the car, we took turns writing letters to Shandi and pressing the notes through the narrow glass neck. Then, with a running start and a determined leap, Florian threw the bottle of wishes over the precipice.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">I held him by the waist as we watched the waves beat one, two, three, four. Let’s get married, I said. I always wanted my sister to be at my wedding, walking me down the aisle. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Sisters have the greatest of loves, the closest of relationships: They give each other self-esteem and keep family ties alive. With who else do you share a mother, a home, an upbringing, secrets? The sister relationship is supposed to be the longest-lasting, longer than the time with our parents, the years with our spouses. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">There’s some dogs who become good at truffle hunting, guarding property, guiding the blind, or easing the ill. And then there’s Shandi, who was naturally, simply, good at the thing I needed most: being my sister. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">It was impossible to think of how I could face a world without the only family member that was really </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">there, </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">unwavering, no matter the circumstance</span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">. </span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Ever present for me to hold, to play with, to breathe into. Both of us were girls with a penchant for Teresa Teng songs, tuna and bread, and the smell of wet grass. We were eager to please, so quick to acquiesce. She grew up fast and we entered our teenage years at the same time. We went on adventures to the mall and to the park, chasing boys and soccer balls. When I was with her, the world — which had previously been impervious to me, like a clenched fist — opened up to us. People waved and smiled, and I would wave and smile back, and Shandi would greet them with a nuzzle and dance circles around their feet. Days were gentler with her by my side, filled with sunshine and snacks and song. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">She loved outings, new places, and open spaces. In these moments her ears would hike up, her feet would tippy-tap, and her whole presence would lift as if she had swallowed the moon. She would make the most joyous puppy sound, ringing from the insides: </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">hnnng,</span></i> <i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">hnnng, hnnng.</span></i></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">At our childhood house, she often retreated under furniture and stayed there, quiet. Ours was a family prone to loud noises, overturned tables, a phone thrown against the wall, people being hit. Here I devised an addition to the three instinctual reactions when in crisis (fight, freeze and flight): go to sister and hold her tight. She was the one I would look for, to lean my ear against her beating heart, or press my face into her butter-soft belly — an ostrich hiding in fur. We were good at playing dead together, two girly lumps in a corner, pretending to sleep, counting the moments, waiting for time to pass. How many times I&#8217;ve listened to her heartbeat to drown out painful sounds, to tide through tense times. One, two, three, four.</span></p>
<blockquote class=""pullquote centre""><p>We slept on the same bed, ate the same food, and lived with the same stomping, screaming, tired woman who made rules for how we were to behave and punished us when we broke them.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Her capacity for love was endless, and she was a refuge for others, too. In a house of few reprieves, small moments of humanity happened with Shandi. </span><a href=""https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/maids-foreign-domestic-workers-singapore-necessity-families-847201""><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Every fifth household</span></a><span style=""font-weight:400;""> in Singapore employs a live-in foreign domestic worker. It&#8217;s common to have help, and maids are allowed a day off a week, but my mother’s maids worked round-the-clock. Accused of doing their tasks poorly, they were continually made to labor harder, longer, and without rest. With errands teeming to be completed day after day there was no time for them to leave the house, my mother insisted. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">These women quickly learned my sister offered one of the scarce chances they had to be free from my mother&#8217;s watchful eye. In Shandi&#8217;s routine walks, our maids got to walk on grass, talk to fellow dog walkers, wave to babies, laugh, make jokes, and look at the sky. They got to be human. Walking with Shandi gave them a small semblance of normality, a narrow view of the world outside of our cramped apartment. I&#8217;d like to think it emboldened some of them to seek work with more peaceful homes.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">When I was awarded a scholarship to study in America — the only way I could put myself through school — it was my chance to leave, too. It was an opportunity for a new start, away from the harshness of the home I knew, and it came with a cruel condition: I had to leave Shandi behind. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">There is no easy way to express how much it pained me to leave my sister — a sister who I had previously spent every night dreaming with, holding her paw; a sister who can&#8217;t video call, send letters, or visit. The last photo I have before leaving for the airport that year, 10 years ago, is of me draped over my sister&#8217;s chest, kneeling on the grass, eyes red with tears. I left her a well-worn hoodie of mine, hoping she would at least have my smell. I didn&#8217;t know how to leave enough of my love to withstand the rest of the years. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">During my time living abroad, I made a Tumblr account named after my sister, to serve as her proxy. I blogged in secret, writing private letters addressed to her. I made an email account with her name. When I missed her, when I longed for her softness, her warmth, her smell, I wrote. I described snow, heartbreak, and American slang. I told her how much I wished she could be here; how much I wanted to take her roaming around the forests of New Hampshire. I missed her breath, her wet nose, her ears like velour. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">I told her my dreams, dreams that were so out of reach that I was too embarrassed to tell anyone else. I imagined her receiving them, listening calmly, extending her paw.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Tapped as the stand-in for my father from the time she joined the family, I always knew that when the time came, she would be the one to walk me down the aisle. On Sunday, the day after we received the news, Florian proposed to me on a beach in Scarborough. He had the ring the whole time, he told me, preparing for the right romantic moment. What was a matter of timing became a matter of prudence. I put the ring on, packed my side of our Cape Town apartment, and departed for Singapore four days later.</span></p>
<blockquote class=""pullquote centre""><p>Let’s get married, I said. I always wanted my sister to be at my wedding, walking me down the aisle.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">When I think of Shandi in Singapore all those years, I imagine a sad and lonely existence, of how the people around her failed to pay attention. </span><span style=""font-weight:400;"">From the time Shandi came to our family, she was beleaguered with troubles. Early on in her life, my mother — a first-time dog owner — clipped my sister&#8217;s nails to half of their length. (She didn&#8217;t know to look for the quick.) Frustrated with the bloody mess on her floor, she relegated Shandi to the back kitchen and went to bed. I remember wrapping my sister&#8217;s toe with flour and kitchen napkins, and when the bleeding continued, I called an emergency vet, who instructed me to take her in. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">&#8220;I&#8217;m 14,&#8221; I told them, &#8220;I can&#8217;t drive.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">&#8220;What about your parents?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">I didn’t know what to say, so I mumbled something about it being fine — to assure them, or myself, I can’t tell the difference. I stayed with Shandi on the kitchen floor, clutching her crumpled toe. Blood ran from her paw to mine.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">This time, when I made it out of South Africa, out of quarantine and to her side, she reminded me of that small hurt puppy from before, all ribs and skin and bleeding sores. In 10 years, she had aged 70, yet she still had the affect of a baby. Her innocence never wore thin. Haloes of white had formed on her face and lower body, and she looked ethereal. My hands sunk into the cloud that was her fur and I pulled her close. I inhaled deeply, taking in her shimmery eyes, her broken teeth, the wetness of her lips, the cool roughness of her nose.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The first night back by her side, I called Florian and pressed my phone&#8217;s receiver against her beating heart. &#8220;Listen,&#8221; I said, laying on the floor and holding her paw. Together we listened to Shandi&#8217;s heart beating, one, two, three, four. We promised to get her out this time.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">I was utterly in love with my sister, delirious over being reunited, resuming our sleepovers, our shared meals, our sisterhood. I watched her blonde eyelashes as she slept, whispering, “I love you!” Sitting down to draw her in the park, “I love you!” Cleaning her buttocks, her wounds, “I love you!” Sneaking into the veterinarian’s office after she was shaved for an ultrasound, I crawl on the floor, I collect her fur, “I love you!” </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Singapore finally relaxed its COVID-19 rules enough to grant an exception for relatives of Singaporeans to enter in late July, 2021. In two short weeks, Florian sold most of what he owned, packed his life into two neat suitcases, and boarded a plane from South Africa to meet us. It was his first time in Asia. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Here was a man uprooting himself in order to uphold a promise: to love my sister, and to take care of her, ʼtil the end of her days. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">We wed in our new apartment two days after Florian completed quarantine, my sister between us; our ring-bearer. In my vows, I thanked her for walking me down the proverbial aisle and passing the beacon — and literally, the ring — onto the next person who will continue what she has done for me all her life. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">In that apartment, Florian, Shandi, and I would go on to create our world — a home with padded alphabet foam floors and carpets to keep Shandi from slipping, a dog bed in every room. We made a choice to withhold chemotherapy and instead focus on managing her pain. Each day, we tune into the rise and fall of her chest in the morning, the consistency of her stools at first pass. We concern ourselves with the shape of her stride, the wobble of her hips, the state of the grass, and whether it would be a good time for a walk. Acts of attention — toward Shandi, toward the fundamental nature of the world in which we live. It is a grounding in what matters. </span></p>
<blockquote class=""pullquote centre""><p>I stayed with Shandi on the kitchen floor, clutching her crumpled toe. Blood ran from her paw to mine.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">As a child, when I wanted a dog — years before we had Shandi — the adults around me warned of the level of care a puppy needs: “Puppies are a lot of work, they poo everywhere, chew stuff, need to be trained, are you sure you want to take care of it?” No one mentioned I was getting a companion that would likely die before me, or the ache and grief of watching illness and old age befall that once-small furball. In </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">The Last Walk</span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">, Jessica Pierce writes, “When we commit to owning an animal, we must commit all the way to the bitter end, as in a marriage.” To take care of a young being is a feat of creation, a celebration of continuity. To take care of a senescing being is a slow, sweet grief, a leaf turning inward into itself, a kind ouroboros. It is an honor.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">So it is my honor to be with Shandi at the start and end of life, when we are the most intimate, the most helpless, wholly dependent. One day, as I was bathing Shandi and singing to her, I thought about my own baths as a child and my grandmother singing to me. I lived with my grandmother until I was 10. Ah ma would go into the bathroom with me and bathe me, then set me at the edge of her bed, my feet toward the center, my long hair toppling over to the side. Sitting on the floor, she would comb my hair slowly, separating each tangle with her long, bony fingers. Next, she would dab my hair with a towel, pressing down gently around my temples, the back of my neck, soaking up moisture. Finally, the hair dryer would appear, to take care of the remaining dampness. It was care, sustained mindfully, without speed, without concern for efficiency. It was attention given through touch, from feeling and cleaning another being, paying notice to what is needed: whether the bathwater is too hot, whether you are combing too hard. The questions I ask myself for Shandi are the same questions my grandma used to ask for me. I am reminded of the physicality of love. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">I want to experience as much of Singapore as I can, with Shandi. Our travels are short. At 14, she tires easily. Still, we&#8217;ve soaked her paws in the mineral waters of the Sembawang springs, watched the light show with her at the Gardens by the Bay, and pushed her in a wagon (the Shandimobile) up the Enlightenment trail at Haw Par Villa to the Goddess of Mercy at the top. During the mid-autumn festival, when children run around the streets with brightly lit lanterns that make festive sounds; we made Shandi into ours. We wrapped Christmas lights around her collar and walked her — our lantern of joy, illuminated — surrounded by a sea of children and musical dragons and orbs and golden suns. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">We have seen more of Singapore in the past months than when I lived here for the first 19 years of my life, tourist attractions and hawker centers and all. I don’t always know how much these actions make Shandi’s life better, or help to forestall the cancer from taking her, but two things I know to be true:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Firstly: She has outlived her prognosis. Veterinarians tell me she is a statistical anomaly, an aberration. A specialist even wondered if the cancer was misdiagnosed after all. None of the vets have seen a dog survive for over a year with hemangiosarcoma. And still, she persists.  </span><span style=""font-weight:400;""><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">Secondly: When she’s outside, her ears tip upwards, her feet tippy tap dance, and she makes my favorite sound, that sweet puppy-like chest hum from 14 years ago: </span><i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">hnnng, hnnng, hnnng</span></i><span style=""font-weight:400;"">.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">When I walk with Shandi down the grassy patch of my apartment block, I notice dogs of all ages peer out from between steel balustrades on the balconies above us: there’s a bulldog with an Elizabethan collar, a dachshund just born, two collies sleeping under curtains, an old terrier on a table. I am reminded that each of these dogs leaves part of a human to the mercy of timelines far shorter than a human lifetime. They are a testament to time’s hand ticking at a speed seven times greater than we know it to be, the heady scent of puppy love that ripens to solid notes of care and joy and grief and heartbreak at old age. Gazing upon the sky, at all those balconies with dogs above, I imagine each of them walking down the proverbial aisle that is Life with their companions, each of them aware of that star-crossed covenant with time, and unhindered, they say, “ʼTil death do us part, I do. I will.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:400;"">My sister likes to walk ahead. I will keep her in my gaze, I will hold my end, I will keep the pace — until the time comes for the one thing I have to let her do alone. Til then, I do. I will. </span></p>

<p class=""top5-credit"" style=""margin:0 0 1em;""><em>Jason Fagone and Alexandria Bordas | The San Francisco Chronicle | July 10th, 2022 | 6,195 words</em></p>
<p>Before Roe vs. Wade, there was “the List”: a secret document that helped 12,000 people get safe abortions in the 1960s and ’70s. Created by Patricia Maginnis, a former U.S. Army nurse, the List began as an activist project and evolved into a clandestine yet well-organized health care system that spanned multiple countries, notably Mexico, which was viewed as the best, most affordable option at the time. Fagone and Bordas sift through a trove of Maginnis’ documents, including letters from desperate women seeking access to competent providers, and describe what some of these women had to go through to get the vital care they needed. “If you don’t know about the past, you cannot learn from the past,” said Karen L., one of the women who got an abortion in 1968 with the help of this underground network. The List, a “road map for breaking the law” when abortion was illegal, now provides a blueprint for the present. —<a href=""https://twitter.com/cherilucas"" rel=""nofollow ugc"" aria-expanded=""false"">CLR</a></p>

<p><em>Jennifer Senior | The Atlantic | June 6th, 2022 | 10,500 words</em></p>
<p>It’s hard to write about liars and megalomaniacs who are also raging bigots — which is to say that profiling the people angling to shove America fully over the fascist brink requires being able to recognize, endure, analyze, and contextualize hateful bullshit. Jennifer Senior was up to the task — no surprise for the most recent Pulitzer Prize winner in feature-writing — in her profile of Steve Bannon, who just this week agreed to testify before the Jan. 6 committee. Senior paints a picture of a dumpster fire and implores readers not to look away: Bannon, she explains, is a powerful agent of chaos, keen to leave “a smoldering crater where our institutions once were.” Senior’s use of first-person perspective and text messages in her storytelling is expert. So too is her depiction of Bannon’s slippery relationship with facts and ethics. (OK, in the latter case there’s no relationship at all.) It’s hard to come away thinking Bannon will tell the truth in his congressional testimony, unless it serves his goal of “attempting to insert a lit bomb into the mouth of American democracy.” —<a href=""https://twitter.com/seywarddarby"">SD</a></p>

<p><em>Lachlan Summers | Noema | July 14th, 2022 | 3,699 words</em></p>
<p>Mexico City’s two most significant earthquakes happened exactly 32 years apart, in 1985 and 2017. Both further destabilized what is already a miracle of geology: As Lachlan Summers puts it, CDMX is, seismically speaking, a “floating city.” For many residents who lived through one (or both) of these quakes, such disruptions were neither beginning nor end. These <em>tocado</em> — touched as they are by a combination of PTSD and vertigo — find themselves assaulted by sensory reminders of the entropy around them. “Cracks in a wall, shifts in the Earth’s surface, the angles at which buildings lean,” Summers writes, “people who are tocado have geological sensors that foreground the indicators of the city’s ongoing collapse.” A PhD student in anthropology, Summers has spent years speaking with the tocado, and posits their difficulties as the result of temporal collision: the epochal irrupting into the timeframe of lived human experience. This is a piece that delivers poetry and terror in equal measure, a quiet awe at the enormity and fragility of our physical world. And in a week we all spent marveling at the images from the James Webb Space Telescope, it serves as a crucial reminder that the infinite doesn’t lurk solely overhead — but all around us, in every fissure and foundation. —<a href=""https://twitter.com/provenself"">PR</a></p>

<p>“Why struggle to stay?” asks Lupita Limón Corrales in this essay on pandemic life, reimagining both public and private space, and living in California — which, for many, has become impossible. I’d realized after reading the piece that it was published last year, but these observations still feel so fresh, as I continue to ask myself questions in the face of constant devastating news: <em>Should we leave? Is everything pointless? What are we even doing?</em> I’m most drawn to the musings on our changing relationship to space, such as the movements the privileged among us have been able to make, and how those shifts have affected other people and the ecosystems around us. (Who wins and who loses in this remote work revolution?) Corrales reflects on an uncertain present, but considers a future — one where communities mobilize and people come together — with much-needed optimism. “Maybe rather than asking ‘Should I leave or should I stay?’ we should ask, ‘In which versions of the future can everyone have a choice?&#8217;” I share this one in the hope that you, too, may benefit from its beautiful insights. —<a href=""https://twitter.com/cherilucas"" rel=""nofollow ugc"">CLR</a></p>

<p>There is something lovely about an essay that includes the phrase, “I need more ka-chunkers,” and Anna Wiener’s dive into the bizarre world of Foley sound effects is endlessly delightful. I love learning about things that I never even knew <em>were a thing. </em>I assumed that sound effects were always added post-production in some soulless studio. I was wrong: The sound of E.T.’s movements — just one example — is raw liver sliding around in a packet and “jello wrapped in a damp T-shirt.” Wiener finds that although “technology has changed the process of recording, editing, and engineering sounds &#8230; the techniques of Foley have remained stubbornly analog.” Wiener spends time with the Foley artists at Skywalker Sound, and their passion is infectious. As I read, I found myself starting to listen differently: Could slurping this cup of tea be an alien slug sliding off his chair in his intergalactic spaceship? Could munching this packet of crisps be centaurs rustling through the forest?

http://restartmed.com/rss,Brazil Nuts And Your Thyroid: Helpful or Harmful?,"
<h2>Why Do So Many Thyroid Patients Eat Brazil Nuts?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Brazil nuts are often the go-to source of selenium for many thyroid patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They consistently make the list of top&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/7-thyroid-superfoods/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid superfoods</a>&nbsp;and are up there with seaweed and oysters in terms of thyroid-boosting benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder then why so many thyroid patients eat brazil nuts on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main reason for this is that they are the most selenium-rich food available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why would you want selenium for your thyroid?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, once you understand how important selenium is for thyroid function it becomes quite obvious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Selenium helps&hellip;</p>

<p>These are all benefits that just about every single thyroid patient would want.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While there are many benefits to consuming brazil nuts, it&rsquo;s not always rainbows and roses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, brazil nuts are far from perfect and have the potential to cause some problems if used incorrectly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today you will learn:</p>



<ul><li><em>More about why so many thyroid patients consume brazil nuts on a daily basis.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>The nutritional content of brazil nuts and why they are so healthy for your thyroid.</em></li><li><em>The 3 potential downsides to using brazil nuts as your primary source of selenium.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>How selenium supplements compare to brazil nuts and which is the preferred source to use for thyroid patients.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>And how to use brazil nuts correctly.&nbsp;</em></li></ul>

<h2>A Deeper Dive Into Nutritional Value of Brazil Nuts</h2>



<p>Yes, brazil nuts are known for their incredibly high selenium content but they also contain a number of other thyroid-boosting ingredients as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each one-ounce serving of brazil nut contains roughly:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><em>542 mcg of selenium 774% DV</em></li><li><em>0.5 mg of copper 55% DV</em></li><li><em>106 mg of magnesium 33% DV</em></li><li><em>205 mg of phosphorus 30% DV&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>0.3mg of manganese 17% DV</em></li><li><em>0.2 mg of thiamine 12% DV</em></li><li><em>1.6mg of vitamin E 8% DV</em></li><li><em>1.1 mg of zinc 8% DV</em></li><li><em>45.2mg of calcium 5% DV</em></li><li><em>186mg of potassium 5% DV</em></li><li><em>0.7mg of iron 4% DV</em></li></ul>



<p>Of the nutrients listed above&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/selenium-thyroid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">selenium</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/magnesium-and-hashimotos/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">magnesium</a>, thiamine, vitamin E,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/zinc-thyroid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">zinc</a>, and&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/hypothyroidism-iron-deficiency/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">iron</a>&nbsp;all have the potential to help your thyroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the doses of the other ingredients are less than what you need on a daily basis, they still have thyroid-boosting potential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zinc, for instance, helps with&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/t4-to-t3-conversion/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid conversion</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iron is required to&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/vitamins-you-need-to-create-thyroid-hormone/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">produce thyroid hormone</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vitamin E is necessary for thyroid hormone cellular sensitivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the list goes on and on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I bring this up because it&rsquo;s important to evaluate foods in context with more than just any one single ingredient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, the selenium content is certainly important, but the benefits that thyroid patients observe when consuming these nuts probably stem from more than just the selenium.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though, it&rsquo;s hard not to be excited about the abnormally high selenium content because it&rsquo;s very rare to find a single food with such a high concentration of any single vitamin or nutrient.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>3 Problems with Brazil Nuts</h2>



<p>Even though brazil nuts are jam-packed with thyroid-supporting nutrients, they are far from perfect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean they should be avoided (though, that is sometimes a good idea) but it does mean you should be aware of all of the pros and the cons before deciding if you should use them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since we just discussed some of the benefits of brazil nuts it&rsquo;s only fair to talk about some of the cons as well.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#1. Selenium Content Varies From Nut to Nut.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>When you are supporting your thyroid or any system in your body for that matter, it&rsquo;s a good idea to know exactly how much of something you are taking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After all, some nutrients can cause problems if taken in excess.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Normally, this isn&rsquo;t something you have to worry about because plants and animals typically regulate nutrients in their own bodies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because we then consume plants and animals, we assimilate their nutrients into our own bodies thereby taking advantage of that regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, animals and plants have systems in their bodies (just like us) to prevent against toxicity of various nutrients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This prevents us from overconsuming certain nutrients in plants and animals indirectly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is normally the case but doesn&rsquo;t always happen perfectly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, the selenium content in brazil nuts is rarely ever consistent and depends on 3 factors:</p>



<ul><li><strong>The selenium uptake and accumulating capacity of the plant</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Some plants accumulate more selenium than others with&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6724122/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">brazil nut trees</a>&nbsp;(7) being on the higher end of the spectrum. Brazil nut trees will typically take up as much selenium as possible based on what is available to them in the surrounding soil. Plants that take up high amounts of selenium are known as hyperaccumulators.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Soil selenium content</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Even though brazil nut trees are hyperaccumulators of selenium doesn&rsquo;t mean that each plant contains the same amount of selenium. Plants can&rsquo;t move around like we can so they are dependent upon the selenium content of the soil in which they live. If that soil content is high, then the content of selenium in the brazil nut tree (and subsequently brazil nuts) will be high. The opposite is true if the soil content is low. The result is that the selenium content of plants varies from plant to plant even within the same generalized area.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>And the presence of other elements in the soil which compete for selenium absorption</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Plants take up selenium around them through&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.02074/full"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">sulfate transporters</a>&nbsp;(8) in the roots. As you might have guessed, more than just selenium uses this transporter including sulfate. Both sulfate and selenium compete for transport into the roots of plants because they both share the same transporter. When there is more sulfate than selenium in the soil it can impair the transporting of selenium due to competition. This acts as another mechanism that may impact the selenium content of brazil nut trees.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>When you put all of these factors together it&rsquo;s easy to see that one big problem with brazil nuts is that their selenium content can vary dramatically from nut to nut.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28923728/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">one study</a>&nbsp;(9) which looked into this very problem found that the selenium content of brazil nuts could vary anywhere between 11% of the dairy requirement of selenium all the way up to 288%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This same study found that the selenium content in soil was also highly variable and ranged from &lt;65.76 ug kg to 625.91 ug kg.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you put this information into context, brazil nuts from the same country can provide anywhere from 6 mcg of selenium all the way up to 154mcg of selenium in each nut.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talk about variability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why is this a problem for thyroid patients?</p>



<p>Well, selenium really only will have benefits if it&rsquo;s used in the right amount.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are consuming brazil nuts thinking they have 50mcg of selenium in each nut and you eat 2 nuts per day to try and get your recommended daily dose for your thyroid, you could be getting as little as 11mcg instead of the 100mcg of you are aiming for.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the flip side, you could be getting as much as 308mcg of selenium in 2 nuts if the tree they came from happened to live in selenium-rich soil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will lead to inconsistency in your daily selenium intake and may cause issues from either taking not enough or too much since selenium is really a Goldilocks type nutrient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this leads us to point #2&hellip;</p>



<h3>#2. It&rsquo;s Easy to Take Too Much.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Brazil nuts have been found consistently to contain the most amount of selenium out of all available foods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is definitely considered a good thing because it&rsquo;s often very difficult to get a huge dose of any individual nutrient by just eating one food.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s sometimes very difficult to get all of the daily vitamins and nutrients you need each and every day by eating real whole food.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This shouldn&rsquo;t stop you from trying but you should be aware that it is difficult which is why many thyroid patients choose to supplement to make sure they hit those goals.</p>



<p>While it is great that brazil nuts contain high amounts of selenium, it&rsquo;s also a potential problem for some people who may not be aware of just how much selenium each brazil nut can contain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are unaware of this issue then you could easily grab a handful of brazil nuts on any given day and consume way more selenium than your body needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And you really don&rsquo;t have to consume very many to incredibly high levels of selenium.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eating 6-8 brazil nuts can yield up to&nbsp;<a href=""http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Selenium-HealthProfessional/"">544mcg of selenium</a>&nbsp;(10).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eating 12-16 brazil nuts can yield up to 1088mcg of selenium.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And eating up to 20 brazil nuts may provide as much as 1,554mcg of selenium.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember:&nbsp;</p>



<p>The RDA for selenium is at 50mcg per day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even though the RDA is set at 50mcg per day, thyroid patients do typically benefit from slightly higher doses usually in the range of 50mcg to 150mcg.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But no matter how you look at it, the numbers quoted above are much higher than what is recommended for the regular population and for thyroid patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Will taking too much selenium cause a problem?</p>



<p>Yes, and no.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taking huge doses of selenium in one sitting probably won&rsquo;t cause a lot of issues but you may run into trouble if you consistently consume that much over a period of time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know that true selenium toxicity, known as&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK216723/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">selenosis</a>&nbsp;(11), is quite rare and doesn&rsquo;t happen very often, at least not in humans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So it&rsquo;s highly unlikely that consuming massive amounts of selenium will lead you to the hospital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have a&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3225252/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">study from 2008</a>&nbsp;(12) which followed several patients that consumed massive amounts of selenium due to a mislabeled liquid selenium supplement and only 1 person was hospitalized during the incident.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While true toxicity is unlikely, even while consuming 20 brazil nuts per day, it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s a good idea!</p>



<p>Excess selenium intake may not cause hospitalization but it still may cause symptoms, especially in thyroid patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the symptoms you may experience from taking too much selenium tend to mimic the&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/hypothyroidism-symptoms-checklist/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">symptoms of hypothyroidism</a>&nbsp;(clouding your clinical picture).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Symptoms of&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/selenium-toxicity/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">excess selenium</a>&nbsp;include:</p>



<ul><li><em>Diarrhea</em></li><li><em>Fatigue*</em></li><li><em>Hair loss*</em></li><li><em>Joint pain*</em></li><li><em>Nail discoloration*</em></li><li><em>Brittle nails*</em></li><li><em>Nausea</em></li><li><em>Headache</em></li><li><em>Fever</em></li><li><em>Tingling</em></li></ul>



<p>The symptoms listed above noted with an asterisk* are symptoms that are frequently also found at baseline in many low thyroid patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last thing you want to do as a thyroid patient is take something that may appear to make your thyroid symptoms worse!&nbsp;</p>



<p>For this reason, you should be very cautious about how many brazil nuts you take each day given that the dose of selenium content is so variable and that it&rsquo;s really easy to take too much.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, there may be some people out there who purchase an entire bag of brazil nuts and consume way more than they need without understanding the potential complications that can arise from that, but you at least know better now.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#3. Excess Selenium can Make Thyroid Management More Difficult.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Thyroid patients already struggle enough as it is in trying to get their thyroid optimized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It doesn&rsquo;t always make sense to throw something into the mix that may make that process even more difficult.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are accidentally consuming too much selenium then you may find it difficult to figure out where your symptoms are coming from.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you experiencing more hypothyroid symptoms&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/signs-your-thyroid-medication-is-too-low/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">because you are underdosed</a>? Or because you are taking the&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-medication/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">wrong medication</a>? Or because you are taking too much selenium?</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s definitely possible to figure out what is going on but it does take time, energy, and a competent thyroid specialist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are lacking any of these three things then it may not make sense to take something that can potentially make your thyroid more difficult.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Should You Eat Brazil Nuts or Supplement Instead?</h2>



<p>Given that there are both pros and cons to using brazil nuts there&rsquo;s room for a conversation about whether it&rsquo;s better to get your selenium intake from supplements as opposed to food.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Generally speaking, it&rsquo;s usually best to get as many vitamins and nutrients from your diet as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Natural sources of vitamins tend to be much better than supplement versions which are why this is the preferred route.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having said that, it&rsquo;s just simply not always possible or feasible to get all of your nutrients from food which is why supplements exist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether that be from personal food preferences (maybe you just don&rsquo;t like certain foods), because the nutrient you want is in food that is difficult to obtain, or virtually any other reason, supplements have their place for supporting the thyroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to getting selenium, I actually tend to lean more towards the side of using supplements instead of brazil nuts for the following reasons:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>The selenium content of any given supplement will be listed on the back of the bottle</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Supplements are not perfect and even selenium content can vary from capsule to capsule but this variability is usually quite small.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>It&rsquo;s easier to quantify how much selenium you are getting from supplements as opposed to food</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; If you wanted to get an idea of your total selenium intake from all sources then you&rsquo;d have to sit down and really do some math and research. You&rsquo;d need to look at the nutrient content of each food that you consume and then do the math to figure out how much selenium is in each serving and so on. This would be a tedious process and not something that I imagine most people are willing to do. It&rsquo;s far easier to read the back of a few supplement labels and add up that number than it is to find out how much selenium you are getting from food.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>You can more easily tailor your selenium intake to the amount that your body needs</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Even though there are basic recommendations out there for just about every nutrient, those recommendations may not be what works best for you. You may find that you personally do better on lower doses of selenium (or higher doses). You may also find that your individual need for selenium varies over time and so on. It&rsquo;s easier to adjust how much selenium you take in supplements than it is to adjust how much selenium you take from food.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Supplements allow you to have more variety in your diet</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; This isn&rsquo;t a huge deal for selenium because even if you absolutely hated the taste of brazil nuts, it wouldn&rsquo;t be very hard to slam down 1-2 nuts per day. But still, eating food you don&rsquo;t like isn&rsquo;t ideal and not something that I would recommend long-term. Using supplements allows you a little more freedom in terms of what you can eat because you no longer HAVE to consume something (brazil nuts, in this case).&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Even with all of these benefits, though, it&rsquo;s still perfectly reasonable to opt to get your selenium intake from brazil nuts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you choose to go this route, then consider a few helpful tips:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Pay close attention to how you are feeling</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; It&rsquo;s a good idea to pay attention to your thyroid symptoms when you try any new therapy but especially if you are going to start taking brazil nuts. If you notice that your symptoms suddenly get worse when you start using them then that may be a sign that you are getting too much or not enough selenium.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Try to use the same brand/source of brazil nuts</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; If possible, staying consistent with the brand and source of your brazil nuts can help limit selenium variability. This isn&rsquo;t foolproof, though, because soil content still matters but controlling as many variables as possible is still ideal.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Take only 1-2 brazil nuts each day</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Avoid taking more than 1-2 brazil nuts per day. Here&rsquo;s why: consuming more than this may increase your risk of taking too much selenium which may cause problems. Not getting enough is likely to provide no benefit but also should not come at the cost of any extra harm either. So staying on the low side increases the odds that you will obtain benefits without negative consequences.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Add up how much you are getting from supplements</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; If you do decide to use brazil nuts as your primary source of selenium it&rsquo;s still a good idea to have some idea of how much total selenium you are consuming each day. This means you should spend some time looking on the back of the bottle of every supplement you are taking and add up how much selenium you are getting on any given day. You can then add this to the estimated amount of selenium you are getting from brazil nuts to give you an idea of your total selenium intake.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Following these steps should minimize negative outcomes while maximizing positive side effects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you prefer the supplement route then look for supplements&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/product/thyroid-daily-essentials-thyroid-multivitamin/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">such as this one</a>&nbsp;which contains selenium in the right formulation, at the right dose, and combine it with other thyroid-supporting nutrients.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>



<p>Brazil nuts are an amazing source of selenium and selenium is incredibly important for supporting many different thyroid functions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it&rsquo;s possible to get your daily dose of selenium from just 1-2 brazil nuts, it&rsquo;s not always the best idea.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes, it may make more sense to use supplements to finely adjust how much selenium you are getting each and every day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, as always, your mileage may vary and you should always do what works best for your body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now I want to hear from you:</p>



<p><strong>Are you using brazil nuts as your primary source of selenium?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Were you aware of the potential downsides of brazil nuts?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Do you prefer getting your selenium from supplements?</strong></p>

<h2>Thyroid Dysfunction Increases Your Risk of Developing Anemia</h2>



<p>There are a few things that can throw a wrench into your treatment plans if you have a condition like Hashimoto&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of those is anemia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, believe it or not, anemia is often something that is&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6179176/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">misdiagnosed or missed completely</a>&nbsp;(1) by both thyroid patients and doctors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why?&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a couple of reasons:</p>



<p>The first is that the symptoms of anemia and the symptoms of Hashimoto&rsquo;s (and low thyroid disease) overlap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both conditions can lead to symptoms such as&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-hair-loss/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">hair loss</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-fatigue/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">fatigue</a>, low energy,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/cold-intolerance-and-hypothyroidism/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">cold intolerance</a>, leg cramps, decreased ability to exercise, and an overall decrease in quality of life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do these symptoms sound familiar?</p>



<p>If you are like many thyroid patients then there is a good chance you are familiar with some (or all) of those symptoms listed above.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second reason anemia is often missed in patients with Hashimoto&rsquo;s has more to do with how difficult it can be to diagnose the condition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Full-blown anemia is rarely missed but more subtle changes in red blood cell volume (or iron levels, as the case may be) can still negatively impact how you are feeling and yet are&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/low-ferritin/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">easy to miss</a>&nbsp;on standard testing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is further compounded by the fact that patients with Hashimoto&rsquo;s can develop anemia from more than one cause.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This represents a diagnostic challenge for doctors which is why it&rsquo;s often missed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly why we are talking about this topic.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What is Anemia &amp; Why It Matters For Your Thyroid</h2>



<p>Before we talk about the causes of anemia let&rsquo;s discuss more about anemia in general.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is anemia?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Put simply, it&rsquo;s defined as a state of&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499994/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">insufficient red blood cells</a>&nbsp;(2).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why is this a problem?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because these red blood cells carry oxygen to every cell in your body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t have enough red blood cells then your ability to carry oxygen to your tissues, organs, and cells will be compromised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most cells in your body require these red blood cells because they need oxygen to create energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t have enough red blood cells then your oxygen delivery will be reduced which will then reduce energy production in your cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This cascade of problems results in the symptoms of anemia which can then negatively impact your thyroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a relationship between thyroid disease and red blood cell level but that relationship is not fully fleshed out yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we know is that patients with thyroid disease are more likely to develop anemia compared to the average population and that replacing lost thyroid hormone levels can improve red blood cell levels and, therefore, the symptoms of anemia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Low oxygen levels then impair thyroid function and action at the cellular level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this way, the relationship between anemia and thyroid function appears to be bidirectional (they both impact one another).&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a little more complicated than that, though, because just treating your thyroid doesn&rsquo;t always fix anemia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are several ways that Hashimoto&rsquo;s can lead to anemia (different types of anemia) and most of them must be treated separately from your thyroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, if you think you can just focus on your thyroid while ignoring your red blood cell level, you are mistaken.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You need to keep an eye on both.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Causes of Anemia in Patients with Hashimoto&rsquo;s</h2>



<p>As I mentioned above, there are several causes of anemia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each of these conditions results in impaired oxygen-carrying capacity by the body either by directly impacting red blood cell levels or by altering how well they can do their job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of these conditions don&rsquo;t necessarily impact your red blood cell level but, instead, impact the structure of the red blood cell which in turn impacts its ability to do its job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is another reason why you need to be aware of the various causes of anemia if you have Hashimoto&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some are easier to diagnose than others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this in mind, let&rsquo;s talk about the causes of anemia that you should be aware of.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#1. Iron Deficiency Anemia&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The first, and probably the most common, is called iron deficiency anemia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iron deficiency anemia stems from low iron and it&rsquo;s frequently seen in women because of their menstrual cycle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iron is needed by your red blood cells to produce hemoglobin and hemoglobulin is the thing inside of your red blood cells that carries oxygen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t have enough iron in your body then your bones will struggle to make enough red blood cells and you will develop anemia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As red blood cell levels fall, you will see physical changes (paleness of the skin, lips, and hands) as well as changes in your symptoms (fatigue, cold intolerance, low energy, etc.).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before iron deficiency causes anemia, though, it causes iron deficiency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That may sound confusing but let me explain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It actually takes quite a bit of iron loss before your body develops anemia because your body stores iron.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This iron storage can supplement what you may not be able to get for a short period of time before you develop full-blown anemia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iron happens to be very important for thyroid function because it&rsquo;s required by a specific protein to create thyroid hormone in the&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/132/7/1951/4687383"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid gland</a>&nbsp;(3).&nbsp;</p>



<p>This enzyme, known as thyroid peroxidase, is dependent upon iron to function optimally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Low iron states impair its ability to&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/vitamins-you-need-to-create-thyroid-hormone/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">create thyroid hormone</a>&nbsp;which impairs thyroid function.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To make matters worse, low thyroid states impair the absorption of iron in the intestinal tract!</p>



<p>As a result, there are a lot of thyroid patients out there walking around with suboptimal iron levels who DON&rsquo;T have anemia (yet) but are still suffering from the symptoms associated with low iron.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a problem I&rsquo;ve discussed before but is relevant here because even though low iron doesn&rsquo;t always cause anemia it will almost always impair thyroid function.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When iron deficiency gets bad enough, though, it will cause anemia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When that happens you will start to see the physical exam findings I mentioned above and you will see changes in your red blood cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I will go over what to look for and how to test for the various types of anemia later in this article but for now, I just wanted to introduce the idea.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patients with Hashimoto&rsquo;s are more likely to develop iron deficiency anemia for several reasons including:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Decreased absorption of iron in the intestinal tract due to hypothyroidism</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Low thyroid states alter stomach acid production which&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12801042/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">impairs the absorption of many nutrients including iron</a>&nbsp;(4). This issue alone is enough to result in suboptimal iron states.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Women&rsquo;s menstrual cycle</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Women get Hashimoto&rsquo;s more frequently than men due to their hormone profiles which means there are a lot more women with Hashimoto&rsquo;s compared to men. Women also consistently lose iron through their menstrual cycle which occurs regularly. Any loss of blood will result in a loss of iron which must then be replaced. Even a small but consistent loss of blood every month, when combined with decreased iron absorption from thyroid disease, is enough to slowly push someone into iron deficiency territory.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Specialty diets used to treat autoimmune diseases may not have enough iron</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Many patients with Hashimoto&rsquo;s turn to different diets to help control their symptoms and immune system. Changing your diet can definitely help your thyroid (I&rsquo;ve written about this before) but it may come at the cost of causing certain nutrient deficiencies, including iron. Iron-rich foods include&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-to-add-more-iron-to-your-diet/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">meat, fish, and beans</a>, so if your diet restricts these food groups then you should keep an eye on your iron status (this is a good idea for all thyroid patients).&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3>#2. Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia</h3>



<p>You may not realize it but your body needs B12 for more than just energy production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vitamin B12 is also important for the overall health of your red blood cells and&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/anemia/vitamin-b12-deficiency-anemia#"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">severely low B12 can lead to anemia</a>&nbsp;(5).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anemia associated with vitamin B12 deficiency isn&rsquo;t as common as other types of anemia that we are discussing today but it&rsquo;s still important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When your body doesn&rsquo;t get enough vitamin B12 it is unable to create healthy red blood cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While you may have a normal or even healthy number of red blood cells, the red blood cells floating around can&rsquo;t effectively do their job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The result is the inability to hold and carry oxygen to the tissues that need it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>B12 deficiency anemia is rarer than iron deficiency anemia because it&rsquo;s easier to catch and treat before it develops into full-blown anemia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you think about it, you&rsquo;re probably consuming a fair amount of vitamin B12 which has been added to drinks and foods even if you aren&rsquo;t taking a&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/product/power-b-complex/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">formal B complex</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/how-much-vitamin-b12-should-you-take-for-your-thyroid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">vitamin B12 supplement</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, most patients with Hashimoto&rsquo;s have enough vitamin B12 to prevent anemia but not enough that they thrive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But even if your B12 status isn&rsquo;t causing anemia, it&rsquo;s still important to be aware of so that you can ensure it doesn&rsquo;t become a problem for you down the road.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just like iron, patients with Hashimoto&rsquo;s are&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/b12-deficiency-hypothyroid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">more likely to develop vitamin B12 deficiency</a>&nbsp;because of the impact that thyroid hormone has on the intestinal tract.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This can stem from the direct impact that thyroid hormone has on acid production in the stomach or because those with Hashimoto&rsquo;s are more likely to develop another condition called autoimmune gastritis.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#3. Autoimmune Gastritis and Pernicious Anemia</h3>



<p>Autoimmune gastritis is an autoimmune disease of the stomach that results in atrophy and damage to the intestinal lining and special cells in the stomach called parietal cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These parietal cells produce a protein called intrinsic factor which is something your body uses to absorb vitamin B12.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you damage your parietal cells (for any reason) then you will also limit your ability to absorb vitamin B12.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Autoimmune gastritis is, therefore, a common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency and another type of anemia called pernicious anemia (we will talk more about this in a minute).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason that patients with Hashimoto&rsquo;s suffer from these two conditions is quite simple:</p>



<p>Both are autoimmune diseases and they tend to go together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studies have shown that Hashimoto&rsquo;s is one of if not the most common autoimmune diseases and as many as&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405068/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">40% of patients with Hashimoto&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;(6) suffer from stomach-related disorders (such as autoimmune gastritis).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not all 40% of patients will get autoimmune gastritis, but some percentage of that 40% definitely do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is an issue not only for vitamin B12 deficiency anemia but also for other nutrients that your body and thyroid need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We aren&rsquo;t spending a lot of time on those nutrients that don&rsquo;t cause anemia (that&rsquo;s the topic of this article) but you can read more about&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/best-supplements-hashimotos/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">why they are important here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do you know if you have autoimmune gastritis?&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s actually more difficult than you might think to diagnose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The symptoms associated with autoimmune gastritis are very non-specific and include things like nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, fatigue, lack of appetite, iron deficiency anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, and other nutrient deficiencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you can see, the symptoms tend to be non-specific so one of the main ways to diagnose the condition must be that you are aware of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you combine awareness with the association of vitamin B12 anemia and/or iron deficiency anemia, making the diagnosis is a lot easier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this is where pernicious anemia steps into play.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pernicious anemia is a specific type of vitamin B12 anemia that results from a lack of intrinsic factor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Without getting too complex, it&rsquo;s more of a way to&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK540989/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">define the type of anemia</a>&nbsp;(7) than anything else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though autoimmune gastritis can cause pernicious anemia (due to vitamin B12 deficiency) it can also cause iron deficiency due to decreased iron absorption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s because atrophy to the stomach will impact more than just vitamin B12 absorption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For this reason, you need to keep an open mind about the possibility of autoimmune gastritis if you have any sort of anemia related to nutrient deficiencies.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#4. Anemia of Chronic Disease</h3>



<p>Lastly, we have another type of anemia called anemia of chronic disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This type of anemia is different from those that we have discussed so far because it doesn&rsquo;t result from deficiencies in vitamin B12 or iron.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It does however impact your body&rsquo;s ability to utilize iron, and that&rsquo;s the problem here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anemia of chronic disease occurs in patients that have chronic medical conditions or autoimmune diseases for more than 3 months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This type of anemia is caused by chronic inflammation and the impact that inflammation has on your body&rsquo;s ability to utilize iron.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anemia of chronic disease is more common with more severe autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, sarcoidosis, and inflammatory bowel disease, but it still can occur in those with Hashimoto&rsquo;s and is the second most common type of anemia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, anemia of chronic disease often&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5588399/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">overlaps with iron deficiency anemia</a>&nbsp;(8) (the most common cause of anemia) so in reality, you may have a combination of both conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This can obviously make diagnosing the condition difficult.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In anemia of chronic disease, your body locks away iron inside of it so it can&rsquo;t be used to create red blood cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If this happens to a significant degree, then you will become anemic and your red blood cell levels will drop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can often differentiate between iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease based on iron lab tests and iron storage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not quite that simple, though, because they often overlap as I mentioned above.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The treatment for anemia of chronic disease is to focus on the underlying cause which, in this case, means&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/natural-thyroid-remedies/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">treating your thyroid</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By reducing the inflammatory process which is damaging your thyroid, you should be able to liberate the iron already in your body and solve the anemia problem at the same time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can learn more about focusing on more than just your thyroid if you have Hashimoto&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/natural-remedies-for-hashimotos-thyroiditis/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>How To Test For Anemia If you have Hashimoto&rsquo;s</h2>



<p>Now that you have a pretty good idea as to what causes anemia, let&rsquo;s talk more about diagnosing it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As I mentioned, full-blown anemia isn&rsquo;t often missed because testing for it is pretty standard when you go to see your doctor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your doctor will almost always order what is called a complete blood count which lets you know if you have enough red blood cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though full-blown anemia doesn&rsquo;t often get missed, more subtle changes to thyroid function, iron lab tests, and nutrient deficiencies do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So even if you don&rsquo;t have anemia, it&rsquo;s still a good idea to keep an eye on these tests to make sure that you fall into the optimal ranges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s also important to check these lab tests if you are just someone who is continuing to experience low thyroid symptoms despite doing everything else correctly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Testing for anemia isn&rsquo;t hard, as long as you know what to look for.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are several tests that you can use to diagnose anemia:</p>



<ul><li><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.labcorp.com/tests/005009/complete-blood-count-cbc-with-differential"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>Complete blood count</strong></a>&nbsp;&ndash; This test is an easy way to tell if you have enough red blood cells in your body and what your hematocrit is. If you have low red blood cells or a low hematocrit then the diagnosis of anemia is obvious. What isn&rsquo;t obvious, though, is the cause. The complete blood count also gives you a lot of additional information about the size and shape of your red blood cells which can help determine the cause of anemia. No matter what, this is a test that you need to get.&nbsp;</li><li><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/602789"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>MCV</strong></a>&nbsp;&ndash; MCV, which stands for mean corpuscular volume, is found in the complete blood count and gives you information about the size of your red blood cells. A low MCV means you have small red blood cells and is often seen in iron-deficient states. A high MCV means that your red blood cells are, on average, big, and may indicate folate deficiency or vitamin B12 deficiency.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Serum iron studies</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Serum iron studies like TIBC (total iron binding capacity), serum iron, ferritin, and percent saturation, tell you whether your body has enough iron or not. Obviously, low iron states when combined with low red blood cells would indicate iron deficiency anemia. You&rsquo;ll need to get your iron lab tests, though, regardless of the cause of anemia to make sure you rule out iron deficiency anemia and to help diagnose anemia of chronic disease.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Inflammatory markers</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Inflammatory markers, such as<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/how-to-test-for-inflammation/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">&nbsp;ESR and CRP</a>, can help you determine if you have inflammation in your body. Chronic inflammation is the hallmark of anemia of chronic disease which is why these tests are helpful and necessary. You&rsquo;ll also get additional value from these tests if you have Hashimoto&rsquo;s as well.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Vitamin B12 levels</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; You&rsquo;ll want to test for your vitamin B12 status to rule out vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s harder than you might think to diagnose B12 deficiency with lab tests because many of the&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/how-to-test-for-vitamin-b12-deficiency/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">available tests are inaccurate</a>. For more accurate testing avoid the serum vitamin B12 lab tests and instead use the MMA (methylmalonic acid) lab test.&nbsp;</li><li><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-tests/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>Thyroid function lab tests</strong></a>&nbsp;&ndash; If you have anemia and Hashimoto&rsquo;s then you might as well test your thyroid when you are getting these other lab tests mentioned here. This will help you understand if your low thyroid is contributing to the absorption of nutrients or if your anemia is caused by something completely different.&nbsp;</li><li><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16544728/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>Biopsy of the stomach and/or endoscopy</strong></a>&nbsp;(9) &ndash; Lastly, you may ultimately need to get more invasive testing done like a biopsy of the stomach or an upper endoscopy. A biopsy of the stomach may be necessary to diagnose causes of anemia like autoimmune gastritis. An upper endoscopy is necessary to get down to the stomach so you&rsquo;ll probably have both done at the same time. You don&rsquo;t need to start with these tests, though, as it&rsquo;s much easier to start with blood tests than it is with these more invasive tests. They will probably only be necessary if the information you get from the blood tests is confusing or unclear.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>



<p>Have Hashimoto&rsquo;s? Then anemia is something you should be aware of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many different types and causes of anemia and patients with Hashimoto&rsquo;s are more likely to develop all of them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The more common types of anemia include iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease but you can&rsquo;t forget about vitamin B12 deficiency anemia and pernicious anemia from autoimmune gastritis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you aren&rsquo;t feeling at 100% despite doing everything else correctly then it would be worth exploring anemia as a potential cause of those persistent symptoms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t uncover an obvious cause of anemia, you are still likely to find some nutrient deficiencies along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now I want to hear from you:</p>



<p><strong>Do you have both Hashimoto&rsquo;s and anemia?</strong></p>



<p><strong>If so, do you know what type of anemia you have or what caused it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Do you have Hashimoto&rsquo;s and iron deficiency or vitamin B12 deficiency?</strong></p>

<h2>Not Treating Your Thyroid is Costing You Big</h2>



<p>You might be thinking, &ldquo;well, it&rsquo;s a good thing that I&rsquo;m treating my thyroid then!&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But are you?&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are undergoing treatment for your thyroid but still experiencing the&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/hypothyroidism-symptoms-checklist/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">symptoms of low thyroid</a>&nbsp;then whatever you are doing isn&rsquo;t working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the way doctors&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/doctors-fail-thyroid-patients/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">approach thyroid management</a>&nbsp;often results in persistent symptoms of hypothyroidism even when using thyroid medications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll know if you fit into this category because you&rsquo;ll have been told that your lab tests are &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; or &ldquo;normal&rdquo; yet you still experience symptoms of low thyroid like&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-weight-gain/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">weight gain</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-hair-loss/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">hair loss</a>, constipation,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/adrenal-fatigue-symptoms/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">fatigue</a>, and&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/how-to-sleep-for-better-thyroid-health-immune-function-weight-loss/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">sleep issues</a>, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this is where not treating your thyroid costs you big.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many thyroid patients just assume that they will have to live with these symptoms based on what they&rsquo;ve heard from doctors and other patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, if you look at other thyroid patients you will see some scary statistics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many thyroid patients continue to suffer from low thyroid symptoms&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/breaking-down-the-verywell-health-thyroid-survey/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">10 years after</a>&nbsp;their initial diagnosis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this is a huge problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you look at hypothyroidism as something you just have to live with and something that&rsquo;s going to be with you forever then you&rsquo;re missing the point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it is true that hypothyroidism may be with you forever, it&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/is-hypothyroidism-a-chronic-disease/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">doesn&rsquo;t have to be the case</a>&nbsp;that you need to suffer with low thyroid symptoms forever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s a situation, one that you should be actively trying to obtain, where you have thyroid disease but barely notice it because your medication is optimized and you are feeling great.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the state that you should always be trying to achieve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And not trying to achieve this state is where things get ugly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today I want to make the argument that not treating your thyroid may be one of the most expensive things that you can do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you think that eating healthy, buying thyroid medication, or purchasing thyroid supplements is expensive, wait until you see just how much money not treating your thyroid costs you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the end, it should be obvious to you that you should be spending a lot more time and energy learning about your thyroid so that you can get back to 100%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because, unfortunately, you&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/endocrinologist-for-thyroid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">can&rsquo;t count on your doctor</a>&nbsp;to help get you there.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How Much Dealing With Hypothyroidism Will Cost You</h2>



<p>First, let me start by saying that the things we are going to be discussing only apply if you aren&rsquo;t treating your thyroid correctly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, hypothyroidism doesn&rsquo;t have to cost you this much money or cause you this many problems and that&rsquo;s the entire point of this article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to tell you that your life is miserable and that you must suffer from these consequences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, I&rsquo;m trying to help you understand how important it is to take your thyroid and your health into your own hands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, a couple of disclaimers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The values and figures that we will be discussing are just estimates and may not reflect actual prices that you have to pay for any given condition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s obviously impossible for me to accurately assess the cost that any given problem or medical condition will cost any single person so we are going to use averages instead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, just because hypothyroidism tends to cause the problems and complications we are about to discuss doesn&rsquo;t mean it will cause all of them in you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, even though I will throw out some actual values and numbers, think of the consequences as more qualitative than quantitative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, how much is it costing you to not be able to do the things that you love?&nbsp;</p>



<p>That sort of thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With these in mind, let&rsquo;s talk about the costs associated with undertreated hypothyroidism.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#1. The Cost of High Cholesterol.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>We are starting with high cholesterol because this is something that not many thyroid patients realize is connected to their thyroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is well known, and I&rsquo;ve discussed it before, that there is a connection between low thyroid function and&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5831065/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">high cholesterol</a>&nbsp;(1).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lower your thyroid goes the higher your cholesterol goes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means if you are a hypothyroid patient who is being underdosed then you will likely experience high cholesterol.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But here&rsquo;s the problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most doctors consider high cholesterol and hypothyroidism as two unrelated phenomena.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They will happily treat your thyroid with levothyroxine while also throwing you on a&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459188/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">cholesterol-lowering medication</a>&nbsp;(2) like a statin (atorvastatin was the #1 most commonly prescribed medication in&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://clincalc.com/DrugStats/Top300Drugs.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">2019</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the better option would just be to increase your dose of thyroid medication which could then help naturally lower your cholesterol level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>High cholesterol is an expensive medical condition because of its link to&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/01.CIR.85.5.1960"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">heart disease</a>&nbsp;(3).&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s estimated to cost businesses over 200 billion dollars per year due to issues such as lost productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it also costs patients who have it in the form of stress, lab tests, medications, and doctor visits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s hard to pin down exactly how much high cholesterol costs but here are some estimates:</p>



<ul><li><em>The cost of cholesterol-lowering medications may be as high as $2,177 depending on&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.goodrx.com/classes/statins/statin-pricing-comparison"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">which medications you are taking</a>&nbsp;and your insurance.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>The cost of changing your diet to treat high cholesterol is estimated to be around $1.50 to $2 per day or up to $730 per year.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>The cost of cholesterol-lowering supplements (fish oil, red yeast rice, oat bran, psyllium, etc.) could range be another $75 per month.&nbsp;</em></li></ul>



<p>And these values are only for treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They don&rsquo;t take into account the potential for negative outcomes like a heart attack or heart disease which could dramatically increase these numbers due to doctor visits, hospital stays, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What&rsquo;s important to remember here is the connection between your&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3109527/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid and high cholesterol</a>&nbsp;(4).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sure, high cholesterol could be caused by something other than your thyroid but if your thyroid isn&rsquo;t optimized then you won&rsquo;t know for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, if you&rsquo;ve been told that you have high cholesterol then take a good look at your thyroid lab values to see if they are optimized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If they aren&rsquo;t, then that&rsquo;s where you should start.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, if you are someone reading this who doesn&rsquo;t have high cholesterol just remember that it tends to come as you age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So just because you don&rsquo;t have high cholesterol from your thyroid right now doesn&rsquo;t mean it won&rsquo;t come later.</p>



<h3>#2. The Cost of Weight Gain.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Next up is probably one of the biggest and that is the symptom of weight gain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, it is well known that weight gain is a primary symptom of low thyroid function.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can find it in just about any standard physiology or endocrinology textbook out there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As thyroid function falls,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-weight-gain/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">you will gain weight</a>. Period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Low thyroid function slows down the metabolism and results in weight gain through a number of different mechanisms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is why so many hypothyroid patients out there gain weight and have a hard time losing weight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem with weight gain is that it&rsquo;s easy to blame on other factors.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class=""gb-block-image gb-block-image-3344dca6""><a href=""https://www.restartmed.com/shop/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""400"" height=""350"" class=""gb-image gb-image-3344dca6"" src=""https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3.jpg"" alt=""join 80000 thyroid patients"" title=""join 80000 thyroid patients"" srcset=""https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3.jpg 400w, https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3-300x263.jpg 300w, https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3-69x60.jpg 69w, https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3-103x90.jpg 103w"" sizes=""(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"" data-pin-media=""https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3.jpg""></a></figure>



<p>So even if you are a hypothyroid patient who is being undertreated with thyroid medication, your concerns about your weight can be hand-waved away by your doctor suggesting that it&rsquo;s all about your diet and how much you exercise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While your diet and activity level are certainly important for your weight and overall health, they will never be as important as optimizing your thyroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Try exercising more and eating less when your metabolism is 20% less than what it should be because your&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/metabolism-thyroid-hormone/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid is undertreated</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because of these factors, many hypothyroid patients&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-obesity-myth/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">struggle with obesity</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And how much does obesity cost? Quite a bit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some estimate that being overweight (with a BMI &gt; 30) costs women up to&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://stop.publichealth.gwu.edu/sites/stop.publichealth.gwu.edu/files/documents/Fast%20Facts%20Cost%20of%20Obesity.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">$4,879 per year and men $2,646 per year</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The numbers get significantly higher when you factor in the value of lost life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These numbers take into account loss of wages, the price of disability, sick leave, absenteeism, decreased productivity, gasoline use, life insurance premiums, and the value of lost life from premature death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They don&rsquo;t take into account things that you might do to try and help with weight loss including things like programs, gym memberships, diets, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They also don&rsquo;t include the psychological impact that being overweight has on quality of life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I won&rsquo;t get too much into that aspect because if you are struggling with being overweight then all of this is probably well-known to you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is exactly why we are discussing it here today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of focusing on what being overweight will cost you, focus more on how&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/lose-weight-hypothyroidism/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">treating your thyroid can help you lose weight</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No, optimizing your thyroid doesn&rsquo;t result in magical weight loss (though it can for some) for most thyroid patients but it does make losing weight much easier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As I mentioned previously, imagine trying to lose weight with a 20% reduction in your metabolism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now imagine trying to lose weight without that 20% reduction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It just makes everything easier and more doable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key is all about optimizing your thyroid which can be done through the use of&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/best-thyroid-medication-weight-loss/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid medication</a>, natural therapies,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/11-weight-loss-supplements-that-actually-work-with-citations/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">supplements</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/hypothyroidism-diet/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">diet</a>, lifestyle changes, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#3. The Cost of Fatigue.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Perhaps not as important as some of the others we will discuss today is the symptom of fatigue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, fatigue is one of the primary&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/hypothyroidism-symptoms-checklist/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">symptoms of hypothyroidism</a>&nbsp;and is one of the main symptoms that thyroid patients still struggle with&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-fatigue/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">despite taking thyroid medication</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hopefully, you are seeing a trend here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of the problems that thyroid patients face stem from the fact that their thyroid is undertreated and this one is no different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fatigue is one of those symptoms that is hard to pinpoint the exact cause.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So even if you bring up this symptom to your doctor you will probably be hit with something like &ldquo;you are just getting older&rdquo; or something similar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While many factors can contribute to fatigue, you simply can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s not from your thyroid until your thyroid is optimized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of cost, it&rsquo;s hard to know how much fatigue costs any single person due to how variable this symptom can be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s estimated that fatigue costs employers up to&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.nsc.org/work-safety/safety-topics/fatigue/calculator/cost"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">$130 billion dollars per year</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How this breaks down at an individual level is difficult to figure out but if you factor in lost work days then it may cost as much as $3,000 per year.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#4. The Cost of Hair Loss.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Next up we have hair loss.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hair loss is another hypothyroid symptom that can occur if the thyroid remains untreated and is a topic that I&rsquo;ve devoted a lot of time to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re struggling with hair loss then make sure to check out&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-hair-loss/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">these resources</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More to the point of this article, let&rsquo;s talk about how much it will cost you to experience hair loss.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because hair loss varies from person to person, the amount of money that each person may expect to spend on this symptom will obviously vary as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More severe cases of hair loss may require more expensive therapies while less severe cases may be able to be improved with minor treatments like supplements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As far as therapies go, here are a few with their&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/hair-loss/save-money-womens-hair-loss-products"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">associated costs</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Hair transplant</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The cost of this expensive procedure ranges from $5,000 to $15,000.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Hair loss supplements</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Usually around $20 to $50 per month.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Doctor visits, medications, and lab tests</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; This May cost up to $50 or more per month depending on which type of doctor you see and how many medications you use.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>PRP injections</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; $500 to $2,000.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Wigs</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Anywhere from $80 to $300 depending on the quality.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Low-level laser therapy</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Usually in the range of $400 to $500.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>This isn&rsquo;t an exhaustive list of all potential hair loss therapies but it does hit some of the major treatments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These values also don&rsquo;t take into account the psychological impact that hair loss can have for both men and women.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are a patient with hypothyroidism who is also suffering from hair loss then be sure to focus on your thyroid first before jumping into the more expensive options.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It may be the case that treating your thyroid solves most of your hair loss.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#5. The Cost of Depression.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Depression (along with anxiety) can both&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/hypothyroidism-and-depression/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">stem from the thyroid</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem with depression is that many other things can also cause it.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know if your depression is&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6753820/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">caused by your thyroid</a>&nbsp;(5) or by something else unless you treat your thyroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even then, you may find your depression lifts somewhat by treating your thyroid but not all of the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Depression, even when treated and managed with medications, still has a cost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That cost includes the cost of doctor visits, prescription medications, and lost productivity at work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hard costs don&rsquo;t take into account the impact that depression has on quality of life such as experiencing happiness and building meaningful relationships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s hard to put an exact figure on depression but it&rsquo;s estimated that the economic burden of depression is around&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/depression-cost-the-us-326-billion-per-year-pre-pandemic-a-38-increase-since-2010-301284172.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">$236 billion per year</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know how much of that total cost gets passed down to the individual so I will just leave that value here for now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What you need to know as a thyroid patient is that depression may be a sign that your thyroid is being undertreated but you will never know until you attempt to&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/t3-thyroid-hormone-depression/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">optimize your thyroid</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If depression lingers afterward then you know something else is contributing.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#6. The Cost of Decreased Stress Resiliency.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Lastly, we have the cost associated with decreased resiliency to stress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The thyroid is connected to your adrenal glands which produce cortisol.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And cortisol is the hormone your body produces to help you manage stress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As thyroid function declines, so too does your ability to tolerate and manage stressful situations due to this connection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This decrease in stress resiliency can manifest in a number of ways including:</p>



<ul><li><em>The symptoms of adrenal fatigue or burnout</em></li><li><em>Higher frequency of getting sick (decreased immune function)</em></li><li><em>Inability to workout consistently</em></li><li><em>Imbalance in other hormones and systems in the body</em></li><li><em>Changes to your appetite and food cravings</em></li></ul>



<p>It&rsquo;s hard to put a definitive cost on any one of these things but we do know that they most certainly cost something.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>How Much Does it Cost to Optimize Your Thyroid?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Now that you understand how much it costs you to not treat your thyroid appropriately, let&rsquo;s discuss how much it costs to do what it takes to feel better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Optimizing your thyroid definitely takes a lot of time and money but what you need to understand is the concept of opportunity cost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Opportunity cost is a way to describe how much you stand to lose by not doing something.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So in the case of not treating your thyroid, the opportunity cost is huge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We just discussed many of those costs above.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many thyroid patients probably understand this to some degree but I don&rsquo;t think they truly understand or they would do everything in their power to get their thyroid back on track.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So how much does it actually take to optimize thyroid function and how does that compare to the costs above?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Optimizing your thyroid may take any or all of the following:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Finding a&nbsp;</strong><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/how-to-find-a-doctor-to-treat-your-thyroid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>competent thyroid doctor</strong></a>&nbsp;&ndash; This is probably one of the more difficult parts of optimizing your thyroid and can definitely be expensive. Many thyroid patients assume that seeing their primary care provider or endocrinologist is the best option but that&rsquo;s typically not the case. Unfortunately, the best doctors to see for thyroid management typically do not accept insurance which means they are more expensive than traditional options. Seeing the right doctor may cost as much as $300 per hour or up to several thousand dollars per year. If you can get away with a doctor that accepts insurance and who also listens to you then great! But don&rsquo;t waste more than a few months on a doctor that isn&rsquo;t willing to listen to you, change your thyroid medications, or entertain natural therapies to help you get back to 100%.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The use of thyroid medications that may not be covered by insurance</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Many thyroid patients will need to use&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-medications-that-work/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">combination T4 and T3 thyroid medications</a>&nbsp;to optimize their thyroid. Most thyroid patients are taking levothyroxine because it&rsquo;s cheap and often covered by insurance but what good is that if it doesn&rsquo;t help you feel better? Thyroid medications that are likely to help you feel better are often not covered by insurance which means you may have to pay more out of pocket. These medications go by various names and include&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/natural-desiccated-thyroid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Natural Desiccated Thyroid formulations</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/cytomel-side-effects/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Cytomel</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/liothyronine/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">liothyronine</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/10-things-patients-should-know-about-armour-thyroid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Armour Thyroid</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/tirosint/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Tirosint</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/tirosint-sol/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Tirosint-Sol</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/sustained-release-t3/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">SR T3</a>, and&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/compounded-thyroid-medication/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">compounded thyroid medications</a>. Thyroid medication may be required to help you get back to 100% and can cost as much as $200 per month on the high end.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The use of&nbsp;</strong><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/what-are-bioidentical-hormones/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>bio-identical hormones</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;and other non-thyroid prescription medications</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Because hypothyroidism impacts other hormone systems in your body you may also need to take other prescription hormones like estrogen, progesterone, and/or testosterone. These come in gels, creams, and injections and may require a prescription from your doctor. The cost for these hormones ranges from $50 per month all the way up to $100 per month depending on your dose and how they are taken.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Ordering comprehensive lab tests including the complete thyroid lab panel and other hormone panels</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; One of the reasons thyroid patients fail to get better is because they only ever get their TSH and T4 tested. The&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/normal-thyroid-levels/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">complete thyroid lab test panel</a>&nbsp;is necessary to get a more complete picture of thyroid function to help you figure out which thyroid medication is best. Most of the time, the thyroid lab panel is covered by insurance so it shouldn&rsquo;t cost you much but in the off chance that insurance doesn&rsquo;t cover it then you may need to spend up to $300 out of pocket each time you get it tested.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Taking thyroid support supplements</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; I&rsquo;m a huge fan of&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-supplements/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid support supplements</a>&nbsp;and recommend them to all thyroid patients. Thyroid support supplements help your thyroid medication work more effectively and provide your thyroid with other nutrients to help it perform its functions. The cost of thyroid support supplements can vary but may cost anywhere from&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/shop/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">$100 to $200 per month</a>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Changing your diet to healthy whole foods</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Don&rsquo;t expect to feel better unless you learn how to eat healthily. For most thyroid patients this means starting with some type of whole food based diet. Eating healthy doesn&rsquo;t have to be expensive but you can expect to add about $1.50 per day to your current grocery bill. That means an extra $550 per year on top of what you are already spending per person (if you are going to eat healthy then just include your whole family).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Regular exercise and costs associated with that</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The costs associated with exercise don&rsquo;t have to be expensive but they can be depending on what type of exercise you like. If you are someone that likes to do group classes or prefers to work under a trainer then it will be more expensive for you compared to someone that does bodyweight exercises at home while following free youtube videos. You don&rsquo;t have to get super fancy with your workouts, just make sure that you do them consistently. If you need to spend more for accountability to keep you on track then that may make sense for you. Getting meaningful exercise can be practically free (with home workouts) or be as expensive as $200 or more per month.&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-stimulating-exercises/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Do what works for you</a>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Spending time and money to reduce exposure to endocrine disruptors</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Detoxification is important for proper thyroid function and is something that every thyroid patient should be aware of. You don&rsquo;t have to go crazy with detox but simple things like drinking filtered water, eating organic foods, getting an air purifier, sweating several times per week, exercising for lymphatic drainage, and ensuring that you have at least one bowel movement per day can make a huge difference. This section can get expensive but there are always cheaper alternatives to get started with. For instance, you don&rsquo;t need to go out and buy a $2,000 FAR IR sauna in order to sweat (but you can if you&rsquo;d like) or put a reverse osmosis water system in your house. You can start with a sauna at a local gym or by purchasing pre-filtered water both of which are significantly less expensive than the alternatives mentioned previously. My recommendation here is to&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-detox/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">start with the cheap options</a>&nbsp;and spend more as you can.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Improving the quality of your sleep</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; If you aren&rsquo;t sleeping 8 hours per night then you will need to spend some time and money in order to improve your sleep. This may mean you need to purchase a new bed, a better pillow, change up the shades or blinds in your room, purchase blue light blocking glasses, spend more money on energy to keep your room cooler, or even buy products designed to cool off your bed. How much you need to invest in your sleep will depend on the person and can vary in price from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars. No matter what, though, don&rsquo;t underestimate how important sleep is&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/how-to-sleep-for-better-thyroid-health-immune-function-weight-loss/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">for your thyroid and overall health</a>! Don&rsquo;t neglect this step.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Managing your stress</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Another very important aspect of managing your thyroid is managing your stress. The treatments used to manage stress don&rsquo;t have to be expensive, but they do require time. There are a lot of follow-along meditations that you can find for free on youtube and, sometimes, managing your stress can be as easy as going for a walk at the end of the day in nature. More expensive therapies for managing stress may include things like changing up your job, altering your behavior, or removing toxic relationships from your life. It&rsquo;s hard to put a precise price on these things so I will avoid giving estimates, but just know that managing your stress is just as important as the other treatments listed here.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>



<p>Is optimizing your thyroid cheap? Not exactly, but when you compare the cost of not treating your thyroid to the cost of treating it, the numbers make a lot of sense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You will definitely save more money, live a better life, and avoid a lot of stress by spending the time and energy on your thyroid right now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What about those people who have had thyroid problems for years and years or even decades? Is it too late for them?</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s never too late to see improvement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It definitely is more difficult and will require more time and energy to optimize your thyroid the longer you&rsquo;ve had a thyroid problem but it&rsquo;s always worth the effort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now I want to hear from you:</p>



<p><strong>Do you feel that your thyroid is optimized?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Are you suffering from any lingering symptoms of hypothyroidism despite being treated by your doctor?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Do you feel your thyroid is costing you big either in terms of money or its psychological impact on your well-being?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Were you aware of just how much not optimizing your thyroid could cost you?</strong></p>

<p>Is there ever a situation in which it makes sense to use&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/take-levothyroxine/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">levothyroxine</a>&nbsp;to treat hyperthyroidism</p>



<p>It may sound crazy, but the truth is that there might be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, yes, just to clear things up, I&rsquo;m talking about the use of levothyroxine in a patient that is hyperthyroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know that intuitively this doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After all, why would someone who already has too much thyroid hormone in their body want to use thyroid medication?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that make the situation worse?</p>



<p>Well, yes, and no.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Treatments for Graves&rsquo;: Understanding Add Back Therapy or Block and Replace Therapy</h2>



<p>Because this can get confusing, let&rsquo;s talk about some of the basics of hyperthyroidism treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first thing you need to understand is that hyperthyroidism is a disease of excess thyroid hormone in the body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of the symptoms that patients with Graves&rsquo; disease and hyperthyroidism experience are a direct result of this extra thyroid hormone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Symptoms like tremors, sweating, hot flashes, weight loss, diarrhea, and so on,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/hyperthyroid-symptoms-checklist-do-you-have-an-overactive-thyroid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">all stem from this effect</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This hyperthyroid state, and the symptoms that it creates, can result in serious (and potentially fatal) consequences such as a thyroid storm or thyrotoxicosis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, your doctor will want to bring your thyroid levels down as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where anti-thyroid medications step in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;ve been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism then your doctor will most likely have given you a prescription medication meant to block your thyroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The one most often used is methimazole.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem with methimazole is not that it doesn&rsquo;t work but that it often works too well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So when your doctor puts you on methimazole to slow down your thyroid he/she is doing that to bring you back to a normal level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the initial doses of methimazole are often much higher than needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And guess what happens if that&rsquo;s the case?</p>



<p>Instead of experiencing symptoms of excess thyroid hormone, you will start to experience the&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/hypothyroidism-symptoms-checklist/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">symptoms of too little thyroid</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, the thyroid-blocking medication you were taking turns you from hyperthyroid (too much thyroid) to hypothyroid (too little thyroid).&nbsp;</p>



<p>And instead of experiencing the symptoms of excess thyroid hormone like diarrhea, weight loss, tremors, and sweating, you will now experience the symptoms of too little thyroid hormone like&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/methimazole-weight-gain/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">weight gain</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/hypothyroidism-and-depression/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">depression</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/cold-intolerance-and-hypothyroidism/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">cold intolerance</a>, and constipation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many hyperthyroid patients live in a state of relative hypothyroidism because of their dose of thyroid-blocking medication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This often leads to a lot of confusion on the part of the patient (for good reason) as well as residual symptoms that negatively impact their quality of life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This doesn&rsquo;t happen to everyone, mind you, because your doctor will try to adjust your dose to an ideal level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A level that brings your thyroid back to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; while blocking any extra thyroid hormone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a hyperthyroid patient, you&rsquo;ll know that this is no easy task as your doctor is often constantly adjusting your dose up and down to try and find the right level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are one of those people who struggle to get your thyroid medication just right then add-back therapy may be the answer for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Add back therapy, sometimes referred to as&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31713721/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">&ldquo;block and replace&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;(2), opens up the door to another way to manage hyperthyroidism, especially Graves&rsquo; disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The logic behind this treatment is simple:</p>



<p>You will both simultaneously block thyroid function with an anti-thyroid medication while also taking extra thyroid hormone with thyroid medication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, you will use two medications at the same time both of which counteract the other.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Does Add Back Therapy Work?</h3>



<p>Even though it doesn&rsquo;t intuitively make sense that you should use two medications that counteract one another, in the real world it can actually work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s why:</p>



<p>Because of the way that anti-thyroid medications work, it&rsquo;s actually easier to dose them using higher doses than lower doses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means that your doctor can put you on a relatively higher dose of methimazole than you might need which acts to block most of the thyroid hormone and function in your body.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then at the same time, your doctor can provide you with bio-identical thyroid hormone (in the form of levothyroxine or another&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-medication/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid medication</a>) to increase your thyroid up to an ideal level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why does it work?</p>



<p>For starters, doctors have a lot more experience in using thyroid medication than they do thyroid blocking medication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because of this familiarity, you will probably end up feeling better using both medications than just thyroid blocking medication by itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, the data is still unclear but some studies have shown several benefits to using add-back therapy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Potential benefits may include:</p>



<ul><li><em>Assist with the reversal of Graves&rsquo; disease (highly controversial)</em></li><li><em>It may help delay permanent hyperthyroid treatments such as&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/radioactive-iodine/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>radioactive iodine ablation</em></a><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroidectomy-5-things-every-patient-without-a-thyroid-should-know/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>thyroid surgery</em></a></li><li><em>May improve quality of life and symptoms</em></li><li><em>May improve compliance with medications</em></li></ul>



<p>So, does add-back therapy work?&nbsp;</p>



<p>It would appear that it certainly works for some people, especially those who have trouble optimizing their dose of methimazole.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But even if it does work, does it make sense for all hyperthyroid patients to use it? Are there better options available?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&rsquo;m going to make the argument that there might be in just a few minutes.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Does Add Back Therapy or Block &amp; Replace Help Put Graves&rsquo; Into Remission?</h3>



<p>One of the main reasons to use anti-thyroid medications like methimazole is to try and give your body enough time to naturally put Graves&rsquo; disease into remission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you think about it, why don&rsquo;t doctors just immediately cut out the thyroid gland or ablate it with radioactive iodine once they know you have a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism?</p>



<p>The answer is they don&rsquo;t want to do something permanent if they don&rsquo;t have to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So instead of using those permanent options, your doctor will recommend that you take methimazole for some length of time (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC149254/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">usually a few years</a>&nbsp;(3)).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your doctor knows that a certain percentage of patients with hyperthyroidism will&nbsp;<a href=""http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6435849/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">spontaneously experience remission</a>&nbsp;(4) of their Graves&rsquo; disease and no longer need any treatments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The number of patients with Graves&rsquo; disease that experience spontaneous remission varies anywhere from 10% to 40% depending on which study you look at.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any other patients which don&rsquo;t experience remission can then undergo further permanent treatments as needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is why methimazole is so important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It really buys you extra time as a hyperthyroid patient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while you are taking methimazole you should be doing everything in your power to increase the chance that you can put your hyperthyroid state into remission (because the permanent options should be avoided if possible).&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly known why certain patients experience spontaneous remission of their Graves&rsquo; disease but there are ongoing tests and studies to try and figure that out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s been suggested and shown by some researchers that using levothyroxine (add-back therapy) in combination may increase your odds of putting Graves&rsquo; disease into remission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are some studies that show this benefit and others that do not, so it doesn&rsquo;t look like we know for sure whether it is helpful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But even if it&rsquo;s the case that add-back therapy doesn&rsquo;t help you put Graves&rsquo; into remission, it&rsquo;s still probably worth trying it out if you are suffering from symptoms that impair your quality of life.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Should You Consider Add Back Therapy If You Have Graves&rsquo; Disease?</h2>



<p>Add-back therapy is definitely a good option for some patients with hyperthyroidism but the question is who should try it?</p>



<p>Given that there isn&rsquo;t much risk in adding an extra medication to your existing regimen, I would say that it&rsquo;s a great potential option for many patients with hyperthyroidism and Graves&rsquo; disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if you are still on the fence or if you just want to minimize your exposure to medications then here are some guidelines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can consider add-back therapy if:</p>



<ul><li><em>You are currently having trouble managing your&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545223/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>dose of methimazole</em></a>&nbsp;(5)<em>.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>You are experiencing negative side effects caused by methimazole such as&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/methimazole-side-effects-you-should-be-aware-of-what-to-expect/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>liver damage</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>The symptoms you are experiencing from your methimazole dose cause you to miss or skip doses.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>You want to try and prevent radioactive iodine ablation or thyroid surgery for as long as possible.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>You need a high dose of methimazole to keep your thyroid in check.</em></li></ul>



<p>Here are some reasons you may not want to try it:</p>



<ul><li><em>Your doctor isn&rsquo;t familiar with the therapy or doesn&rsquo;t want you to try it.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>You already have trouble remembering to consistently take your dose of methimazole each day.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Your thyroid is perfectly normal while taking methimazole and you are not experiencing negative side effects from that medication.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Your dose of methimazole is already very small.&nbsp;</em></li></ul>



<p>Regardless of which option you should, I would still strongly suggest that you take time to look into&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/natural-thyroid-remedies/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">additional therapies</a>&nbsp;that can be added to your dose of methimazole.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These additional therapies are probably much better than add-back therapy because they may increase your shot of remission.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>A Better Option: Try to Put Graves&rsquo; Into Remission on Your Own</h2>



<p>You can spend a lot of time thinking about whether or not you should consider add-back therapy or block and release therapy but at the end of the day, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The single most important thing you can do as a patient with Graves&rsquo; disease (but this also applies to some cases of hyperthyroidism) is do whatever you can to try and put your disease into remission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though it&rsquo;s so important, it&rsquo;s often not discussed between doctors and patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s why:</p>



<p>We don&rsquo;t have a lot of evidence to suggest that there is a guaranteed way to put Graves&rsquo; disease into remission and the information we do have suggests that it may only be possible for certain people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But does that matter? Should it impact whether or not you try?</p>



<p>Not at all!</p>



<p>The idea that a therapy MUST work in order for you to try it is a silly one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, you should think about a treatment in terms of its cost vs reward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the case of natural treatments for Graves&rsquo; disease, the rewards are potentially very high and the risks are virtually zero.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At least for the treatments that I would recommend that you consider.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For starters, here&rsquo;s a list of things that you can do that may (keyword may) help:</p>



<ul><li><em>Change your diet to eat healthy whole foods while&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4034518/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>avoiding the &ldquo;western diet&rdquo;</em></a>&nbsp;(6)<em>&nbsp;&ndash; There are many diets that can help improve your overall health and potentially help put Graves&rsquo; into remission. The&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/aip-diet/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>AIP diet</em></a><em>&nbsp;is popular among patients with Graves&rsquo; disease but other diets such as the&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/ketogenic-diet-thyroid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>ketogenic diet</em></a><em>, the&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/carnivore-diet-for-hashimotos/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>carnivore diet</em></a><em>, the paleo diet, the&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/graves-disease-diet/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>gluten-free diet</em></a><em>, and whole 30 may also work. There are many options to choose from and the key to success is picking one and sticking with it. Healthy whole food diets such as these may help lower inflammation, improve your gut health, and provide your body with the nutrients it needs to function optimally.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Exercise regularly &ndash; Are you exercising regularly? If not you should be. Exercise helps balance your&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29108826/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>immune system</em></a>&nbsp;(7)<em>, reduces stress, and keeps your hormones at healthy levels. You don&rsquo;t have to get fancy with your exercise routines, either, just staying active 3-5 times per week can make a big difference.&nbsp;</em></li><li><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/product/pure-d3-liquid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Take Vitamin D</em></a><em>&nbsp;&ndash; Low levels of vitamin D may increase your risk of developing autoimmune conditions and we know that patients with Graves&rsquo; disease have&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4446781/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>lower vitamin D levels</em></a>&nbsp;(8)<em>&nbsp;compared to healthy controls. Taking vitamin D won&rsquo;t necessarily &ldquo;cure&rdquo; your Graves&rsquo; disease but it is important for other processes in your body including thyroid function. Increasing your vitamin D is simple with the right supplement.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Consider other supplements &ndash; Other supplements such as&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/zinc-thyroid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>zinc</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/selenium-thyroid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>selenium</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/product-category/probiotics/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>probiotics</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/product/omega-soothe-sr/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>fish oil</em></a><em>, and&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/magnesium-and-hashimotos/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>magnesium</em></a><em>&nbsp;can be considered basic hyperthyroid supplement staples. Many hyperthyroid patients don&rsquo;t have enough of these vitamins and they can easily be replaced with some simple over-the-counter supplements.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Improve your gut health &ndash; It&rsquo;s been said that all disease begins in the gut, which is probably not entirely true, but the adage does carry some weight. Your gut plays an important role in regulating your hormones, immune system, and overall health. If you are experiencing any symptoms such as gas, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, acid reflux, or any other gut-related condition then that&rsquo;s a sign that something is not right in that area and should be addressed.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Manage your&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/cortisol-and-weight-gain/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>stress levels</em></a><em>&nbsp;&ndash; Easier said than done, I know, but managing your stress is very important.

And since the immune system is the primary driver of Graves&rsquo; disease it makes sense that you should get more sleep.&nbsp;</em></li></ul>



<p>These are really just a few simple things that you can get started with right away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And guess what? They can safely be added to methimazole or to levothyroxine if you are opting to use block and replace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only downside is that we don&rsquo;t know how these treatments are at putting Graves&rsquo; disease into remission but we do know that they have worked for other patients out there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And when it comes to thinking about whether or not they are worth it, because the risk is virtually zero and the potential benefit is the prevention of permanent thyroid gland damage, it&rsquo;s obvious that you should at least consider them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No matter how you look at it, eating more whole foods, getting more sleep, and exercising more regularly are things that both conventional and natural doctors can get behind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The question is, does it make more sense to do research on something like block and release while not also paying attention to these treatments?</p>



<p>Not really.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are already spending the time to be an informed patient then you might as well continue on learning.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>



<p>Add back therapy or block and replace is a way for certain hyperthyroid patients to better manage their hyperthyroidism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This treatment paradigm allows you to further refine your thyroid lab tests with another input.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though it doesn&rsquo;t intuitively make sense to use both a thyroid-boosting medication and a thyroid-blocking medication, there are situations where it works.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two of the most common situations in which add-back therapy makes sense are in those hyperthyroid patients who have a hard time managing their dose of methimazole and in those who are trying to prevent radioactive iodine ablation and thyroid surgery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if you do decide to use this treatment just remember that there are other things you can do that may help you put your disease into remission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And doing that is more important than anything else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now I want to hear from you:</p>



<p><strong>Is this the first time you&rsquo;ve heard of add-back therapy or block and replace?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Have you tried this type of treatment before?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>If so, what type of results did you see? Did it help?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Are you planning on making a concerted effort to add treatments designed to increase your odds of putting your disease into remission?</strong></p>

<p>Is it time to start freaking out because you are taking levothyroxine?</p>



<p>Not quite!</p>



<p>As you probably know,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/take-levothyroxine/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">levothyroxine</a>&nbsp;is the most commonly prescribed medication used to treat hypothyroidism, and&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://clincalc.com/DrugStats/Top300Drugs.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">millions</a>&nbsp;of thyroid patients use it every single month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though it&rsquo;s probably not the&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-medication-names/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">best thyroid medication</a>&nbsp;(and may not even be one that you are taking), the fact that new information suggests it may be harmful should matter to you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>New research from a retrospective study has shown a link between cancer risk and the use of levothyroxine in thyroid patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this study, patients taking levothyroxine were found to have about a 50% increased risk of cancer compared to healthy controls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though this may sound terrible, there&rsquo;s more to the story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today we are going to dive into the details of this study and discuss what it means for you as a thyroid patient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, you will learn:</p>



<ul><li><em>More about the details of this study and what types of cancers were seen in patients using levothyroxine.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Why this type of study is not ideal for assessing true cancer risk among thyroid patients.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>What type of variables were not tested for and why we need to have this information in order to make definitive statements.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Other possible drivers of cancer risk in thyroid patients.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>How this information applies to other thyroid medications.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>More about what the results of this study mean for thyroid patients going forward.&nbsp;</em></li></ul>

<h2>Levothyroxine May Increase Cancer Risk by 50%, Study Shows</h2>



<p>So, does levothyroxine cause cancer?</p>



<p>The answer to this question is more complicated than you might think which is why we need to spend some time discussing the results of this study and their impacts on thyroid patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But before we discuss their impact, let&rsquo;s first discuss what the study showed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can find the&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cas.14908"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">full link to the study here</a>&nbsp;(1), by the way, if you want to read it yourself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers from Taiwan gathered data from over 600,000 thyroid patients (and 2,400,000 million controls) to assess whether levothyroxine use was associated with an increased risk of cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These researchers used a database called&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6509937/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Taiwan&rsquo;s Health and Welfare Data Science Center</a>&nbsp;(2) database which is a massive database of health information among the residents of Taiwan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This database holds information about medical diagnoses, history of medication use, laboratory and diagnostic tests, dates of visits, lengths of hospitalizations, and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This database is constantly being updated so what the researchers did is they looked backward in time by selecting certain criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This allowed them to specifically look at thyroid patients who were taking levothyroxine for a defined period of time and compare their risk of cancer to healthy cancer-free controls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is what is called a retrospective study which means that it uses existing data and compares one group of people to another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This isn&rsquo;t the best form of study but it is a good way to put your foot in the door and to show possible connections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you show these connections you can then use further studies to confirm or deny your suspicions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So even though this study is certainly concerning, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily prove anything.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When comparing healthy controls to thyroid patients using levothyroxine they found that levothyroxine users had an increased risk of the following cancers:</p>



<ul><li><em>Brain cancer</em></li><li><em>Skin cancer</em></li><li><em>Pancreatic cancer</em></li><li><em>Female breast cancers</em></li></ul>



<p>The data also showed that levothyroxine users had a reduced incidence of the following cancers:</p>



<ul><li><em>Esophageal cancer</em></li><li><em>Cervical cancer</em></li></ul>



<p>The total data showed that levothyroxine users had about a 50% increased higher risk of cancer at any site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is certainly concerning information but it&rsquo;s not damning information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So if you are a thyroid patient taking levothyroxine (or any other thyroid medication) sit tight so we can break down why this isn&rsquo;t necessarily a problem and some lessons to learn from this study.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Some Reasons Why You Don&rsquo;t Necessarily Need to Worry</h2>



<p>It may be tempting to brush this data aside, put your head down and keep taking your thyroid medication, but given the fact that it included hundreds of thousands of patients, it&rsquo;s a good idea to address it head-on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as you will soon find out, there is some nuance to this information that probably renders it less impactful than you might think.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#1. Retrospective Studies Aren&rsquo;t Perfect</h3>



<p>The first has to do with the study itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This study is what is referred to as a&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5037941/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">retrospective study</a>&nbsp;(3) which means it&rsquo;s not the ideal way to truly assess cancer risk in a patient population.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retrospective studies take existing data and try to draw conclusions based on what happened in the past.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, this study has a few issues that should be addressed in future studies:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>The issue of data keeping and laboratory testing</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The results are reliant upon data-keeping from those who took the data originally. This can be a problem because the information that you have to work with may not be all of the information you need. If you knew, for instance, that you were specifically assessing for cancer among patients taking levothyroxine you would be very concerned not only with the fact that patients were taking levothyroxine but how that levothyroxine dose was impacting other factors such as TSH, free T4, free T3 levels, pituitary hormones, cortisol levels, and so on. It may be the case, for instance, that those included in this study were severely underdosed compared to populations in the United States. The researchers note that the lack of information on levothyroxine dose influence is a big problem.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The issue of confounding variables</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Cancer is a&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20362/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">very complex disease process</a>&nbsp;(4) and one that we are still trying to understand. Because the data these researchers are looking at already existed, it&rsquo;s difficult to control for factors that can greatly increase the risk of cancer such as&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2726801/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">family history</a>&nbsp;(5), history of smoking/drinking, etc. The researchers had a lot of information to work with but they didn&rsquo;t have all of the information that they would have liked. For instance, a known family history of cancer may have helped exclude certain people taking levothyroxine because of that confounding variable. Aside from the family history of cancer, the researchers weren&rsquo;t able to take into account&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30445141/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">BMI</a>&nbsp;(6),&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6235683/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">smoking status</a>, or&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3307043/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">alcohol consumption</a>&nbsp;(7) all of which certainly have some impact on cancer risk. It may be the case that thyroid patients are more likely to be overweight which accounts for their increased risk of cancer independent of their thyroid medication.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The issue of the data source</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Next and probably one of the more obvious issues is that of the data source. All of the information came from residents of Taiwan which means that it&rsquo;s difficult to take that information and apply it to broad or diverse populations such as what is seen in the United States. It is well known, for instance, that certain ethnicities are more prone to developing&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7852513/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">certain cancers</a>&nbsp;(8) while other ethnicities seem to have protection against certain types of cancers. In addition, location certainly can drive cancer risk given&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5029064/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">environmental factors</a>&nbsp;(9) that may be present in some areas of the world and not others. It could very well be the case that levothyroxine use increases cancer in thyroid patients in Taiwan but not in the United States, for instance.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The issue of limiting information on levothyroxine dosing</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Lastly, the researchers were not able to assess whether thyroid patients were undertreated or overtreated with levothyroxine. All they know is that certain patients met the criteria for taking levothyroxine over a 3-year period and that they were included in the study. What they don&rsquo;t know is how that dose of levothyroxine impacted their thyroid function. Were they taking&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/levothyroxine-overdose/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">too much levothyroxine</a>?&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/signs-your-thyroid-medication-is-too-low/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Too little levothyroxine</a>? We don&rsquo;t know. It could certainly be the case that the actual risk of cancer thyroid medication has little to do with the medication itself and everything to do with the dose.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3>#2. More Research is Still Needed</h3>



<p>While it&rsquo;s good to have this sort of information, it really just opens the door to further research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Research on any given topic is complex and something that evolves over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The type of information we are seeing here is really just saying &ldquo;hey, there&rsquo;s something that we need to look at&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What it&rsquo;s not saying is &ldquo;hey, levothyroxine causes cancer and all thyroid patients should stop taking it&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this distinction is important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes tempting to look at information and try to draw definitive conclusions but this isn&rsquo;t a study where we can do that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can say that the information here is concerning but it needs to be taken in context with what is happening with thyroid patients around the globe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right now we know that thyroid patients are dealing with a lot of issues, especially surrounding the issue of thyroid medication management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you take one quick look at&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/doctors-fail-thyroid-patients/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">the research</a>&nbsp;on the topic you will see that thyroid patients continue to suffer from a variety of medical conditions and thyroid symptoms despite taking their thyroid medication faithfully.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class=""gb-block-image gb-block-image-00c5e4f6""><a href=""https://www.restartmed.com/shop/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""400"" height=""350"" class=""gb-image gb-image-00c5e4f6"" src=""https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3.jpg"" alt=""join 80000 thyroid patients"" title=""join 80000 thyroid patients"" srcset=""https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3.jpg 400w, https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3-300x263.jpg 300w, https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3-69x60.jpg 69w, https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3-103x90.jpg 103w"" sizes=""(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"" data-pin-media=""https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3.jpg""></a></figure>



<p>If you were to take an objective look at that information by itself you would clearly be able to see there is a problem with thyroid medication management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In my mind, this study really just confirms that reality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will talk more about it below but there&rsquo;s a good chance that the results we are seeing here have more to do with how thyroid patients are being dosed than the impact that thyroid medication has on cancer risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, we know that thyroid function is necessary for regulating important cellular processes such as&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK500006/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">enzyme production</a>&nbsp;(10), mitochondrial energy production, and immune function.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are not taking enough levothyroxin1e then these important processes may not be functioning the way they should.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also know that a significant number of thyroid patients are unnecessarily taking&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/how-to-get-off-of-thyroid-medication/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid medication when they don&rsquo;t need it</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are one of these patients then you might be causing more harm than good as your body tries to grapple with extra hormones that it doesn&rsquo;t need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It seems more plausible that being underdosed or overdosed has more of an influence on cancer risk than the type of thyroid medication being used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we simply don&rsquo;t know for sure without more targeted research to help answer these important questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More research drives more clarity and will also open the door to questions we didn&rsquo;t think to ask originally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, the topic is more complex than it appears and we don&rsquo;t even know how complex it is without these future studies.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#3. We Don&rsquo;t Have Information on Other Thyroid Medications</h3>



<p>It makes sense that researchers would use levothyroxine as their criteria for inclusion in this study but you should be aware that there are many other medications aside from levothyroxine!&nbsp;</p>



<p>And each of these medications differs in the type and dose of thyroid hormone that they include.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;ve spent any time&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/blog/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">on my blog</a>&nbsp;(and probably many other thyroid blogs out there) then you&rsquo;ll know that many thyroid patients prefer thyroid medications that contain a combination of T4 and T3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are really only a handful of thyroid medications that contain T4 and T3 and these medications are prescribed in only about 10-15% of patients (estimated).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rest of the low thyroid patients out there are taking levothyroxine.</p>



<p>This is important because what type of thyroid medication you are taking does have some impact on how you view the results of this study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, if you are someone taking a form of&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/natural-desiccated-thyroid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Natural Desiccated Thyroid</a>&nbsp;like&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/np-thyroid-facts/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">NP thyroid</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/10-things-patients-should-know-about-armour-thyroid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Armour thyroid</a>, does the information still apply to you?</p>



<p>What if you are taking a&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/compounded-thyroid-medication/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">combination of T4 and T3</a>&nbsp;in the form of&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/tirosint/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Tirosint</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/cytomel-side-effects/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Cytomel</a>?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We just don&rsquo;t have the answers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It makes sense that thyroid patients using these types of thyroid medications shouldn&rsquo;t be lumped into the same group as those taking levothyroxine but we don&rsquo;t have the data to say for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are someone using NDT formulations, T4 + T3 combos, or some other medication aside from levothyroxine, stay tuned for some information that may help drive your decision-making going forward.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#4. Levothyroxine is Bio-Identical</h3>



<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s worth pointing out that levothyroxine is bio-identical to the thyroid hormone that your body produces naturally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The active ingredient found in levothyroxine is called&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroxine/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroxine</a>&nbsp;which is the same compound your thyroid gland produces when it is healthy and functioning normally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, levothyroxine is considered synthetic in the sense that it is manufactured in a lab but the end result is still a bio-identical hormone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is worth pointing out because it&rsquo;s not like levothyroxine is a Frankenstein-like hormone like the hormones found in birth control pills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When researchers in the early 2000s found a link between&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3963523/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">estrogen and breast cancer</a>&nbsp;(11), the medication in question was not bio-identical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it&rsquo;s been long suggested that&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/what-are-bioidentical-hormones/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">bio-identical hormones</a>&nbsp;are much safer compared to the altered but similar hormones produced by some pharmaceutical companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After all, your body knows exactly what to do with thyroxine because you&rsquo;ve been producing it since before you were born!</p>



<p>And even before birth, your body was able to utilize it because your mother supplied the thyroid hormone you needed before you&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21212091/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">could supply your own</a>&nbsp;(12).&nbsp;</p>



<figure class=""gb-block-image gb-block-image-b400ec4a""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1080"" height=""1080"" class=""gb-image gb-image-b400ec4a"" src=""https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/does-levothyroxine-cause-cancer.jpg"" alt=""does levothyroxine cause cancer? not excactly"" title=""does-levothyroxine-cause-cancer"" srcset=""https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/does-levothyroxine-cause-cancer.jpg 1080w, https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/does-levothyroxine-cause-cancer-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/does-levothyroxine-cause-cancer-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/does-levothyroxine-cause-cancer-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/does-levothyroxine-cause-cancer-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/does-levothyroxine-cause-cancer-800x800.jpg 800w, https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/does-levothyroxine-cause-cancer-100x100.jpg 100w, https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/does-levothyroxine-cause-cancer-60x60.jpg 60w, https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/does-levothyroxine-cause-cancer-90x90.jpg 90w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"" data-pin-media=""https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/does-levothyroxine-cause-cancer.jpg""></figure>



<p>Just because something is bio-identical doesn&rsquo;t mean that it is automatically safe, though, and this comes back to the issue of dosing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we look at something like insulin (which is also bio-identical), we see that excessively high doses of insulin may certainly increase cancer risk in those who take more than they need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same goes for estrogen as estradiol.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Excessively high doses of estradiol may increase your risk of uterine cancer even though it is bio-identical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is all worth discussing because it brings us back to the idea that cancer risk with levothyroxine use may be more associated with dose than the medication itself.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Lessons &amp; Takeaways From This Study</h2>



<p>Even though this study does have some flaws and shouldn&rsquo;t be taken as gospel truth, it&rsquo;s almost certainly going to have some impact on thyroid patients and thyroid doctors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some will be good and some will be bad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about some takeaways, some lessons, and what you might expect going forward.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#1. Don&rsquo;t Take Thyroid Medication Unless You Need it</h3>



<p>One major takeaway is the idea that it&rsquo;s probably not a good idea to take levothyroxine (or any other thyroid medication) unless you absolutely need to be on it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thyroid patients are often surprised when they hear that a pretty significant percentage of thyroid patients are taking thyroid medication when they don&rsquo;t need to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some studies estimate this number to be as high as 30%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if we assume that this information does not apply to you 100%, it&rsquo;s still a good idea to spend some time figuring out if you fit into that 30% that doesn&rsquo;t need to be on thyroid medication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best-case scenario is that you realize you don&rsquo;t need to be on it and the worst-case scenario is that you continue taking it while learning some valuable information along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As some of you may know, my wife has used T3 thyroid medication (without T4) to&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/t3-thyroid-hormone-depression/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">treat depression</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/eating-disorders-thyroid-problems/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">metabolic issues</a>&nbsp;and she was recently able to completely get off of her medication after being on it for years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was convinced that she would need to take it for life but here we are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if you are someone that believes you need to be on thyroid medication for life it&rsquo;s worth a discussion with your physician to see if a trial of tapering off makes sense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This doesn&rsquo;t apply to those without a thyroid or those who are post RAI but many other thyroid patients may be able to try.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can learn more about&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/how-to-get-off-of-thyroid-medication/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">how to do that here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Caution: do not try to wean yourself off of your thyroid medication without physician supervision!</em></p>



<h3>#2. It May Be More Difficult to Get On Thyroid Medication/Levothyroxine</h3>



<p>This could be a good or a bad thing depending on how you look at it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The trend among doctors has definitely been to restrict thyroid medication to a select population of patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some sense, this is okay because you really don&rsquo;t want someone to take thyroid medication unless they need it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And there have been several studies that suggest that taking thyroid medication in the subclinical state is probably not ideal and may result in&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7022757/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">more harm than good</a>&nbsp;(13).&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the opposite side, there are some patients with conditions like early-stage Hashimoto&rsquo;s who see significant benefits to&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/stages-of-hashimotos/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">early treatment from thyroid medication</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I suspect that as this information becomes more widespread that it may push some doctors into being more selective in who they prescribe levothyroxine to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will probably mean that it will be more difficult for patients with early-stage Hashimoto&rsquo;s and early-stage hypothyroidism to get started on thyroid medication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It probably won&rsquo;t have a huge impact on those already taking thyroid medication except for in select cases such as those with low thyroid symptoms who were started on low doses of thyroid medication as a trial.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#3. Optimizing Your Dose is Probably More Important Than What Type of Medication You Take</h3>



<p>There will be plenty of people who read this study who may feel trapped because they know they need to take thyroid medication but at the same time don&rsquo;t want to deal with an increased risk of cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People in this situation may find more success in focusing less on what type of thyroid medication they are taking and more on optimizing their thyroid medication dose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What does this mean?&nbsp;</p>



<p>It means focusing on taking thyroid medications that help you do a couple of things:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><em>Reduce your&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/hypothyroidism-symptoms-checklist/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>hypothyroid symptoms</em></a></li><li><em>Optimize your&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/free-t3/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>free T3</em></a><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/free-t4-normal-range/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>free T4</em></a><em>&nbsp;levels</em></li></ul>



<p>Thyroid medications like levothyroxine contain only T4 which leaves many thyroid patients with adequate free T4 but less than optimal free T3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And when it comes to symptomatic management, T3 levels reign supreme.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are someone taking levothyroxine but still experiencing low thyroid symptoms then make sure to test your free t3 and free t4 levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These free thyroid hormone levels can give you insight as to how your body is processing your thyroid medication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have adequate free T4 but low free T3 or total T3 then you can make the assumption that your body is not converting T4 into the active T3 thyroid hormone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many factors influence your T3 levels and one of those is your thyroid medication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can easily increase T3 levels by taking T3 thyroid medication in the form of Cytomel,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/liothyronine/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">liothyronine</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/sustained-release-t3/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">SR T3</a>, or NDT.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s my current belief that the actual risk of cancer from levothyroxine use stems from being underdosed or overdosed with the wrong type of thyroid medication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using combination thyroid medications like T4 and T3 together more closely mimics what the healthy thyroid gland does in those without thyroid disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Combining this strategy with the ones listed below should give you some peace of mind as it relates to your personal cancer risk.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#4. There are Still Things You Can do to Decrease Your Personal Cancer Risk</h3>



<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s difficult to look at information like this and take it all in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While we&rsquo;ve focused specifically on levothyroxine and its potential impact on your personal cancer risk, it&rsquo;s definitely not the only factor that influences that risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are still plenty of other factors that influence your personal cancer risk and many of those are within your control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can&rsquo;t control what thyroid medication your doctor gives you and you may not able to control your medical diagnoses or family history, but you can control things like how often you exercise and what foods you eat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And when it comes to cancer risk, these things matter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weight gain, for instance, is associated with an increased risk of&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5591063/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">breast cancer</a>&nbsp;(14),&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7352519/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">colorectal cancer</a>&nbsp;(15), endometrial cancer, gallbladder cancer, kidney cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, and the list goes on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because the foods that you eat and how much you exercise are linked to your BMI and weight, these are things that you can control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of allowing this information to stress you out, use it to help you make changes in your life that can help you become healthier and (hopefully) more resistant to cancer going forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two things that you can do right away include exercising regularly and eating a healthy whole food diet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as it turns out, I have free resources which can help you do both!</p>



<p>You can learn more about healthy diets to eat if you have hypothyroidism&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/hypothyroidism-diet/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">here</a>&nbsp;and how exercise can naturally help improve thyroid function&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-stimulating-exercises/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#5. You May be Able to Use This Study to Change Your Thyroid Medication</h3>



<p>It&rsquo;s not all bad news because the results of this study may actually make it easier to switch from levothyroxine to other forms of thyroid medications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s how:</p>



<p>There are many thyroid patients taking levothyroxine still experiencing low thyroid symptoms who have been actively trying to get their doctor to change their thyroid medication for months or even years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They are often met with resistance by their doctor for a variety of reasons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you were to bring this study up to your doctor with legitimate concerns over your own personal risk of cancer then that might be enough to persuade them to switch you to another thyroid medication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This option might work best for thyroid patients such as those who are&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroidectomy-5-things-every-patient-without-a-thyroid-should-know/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">post thyroidectomy</a>&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/radioactive-iodine/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">post RAI</a>&nbsp;as they don&rsquo;t have the same option as other thyroid patients to try and wean themselves off of thyroid medication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If that&rsquo;s the case then the next best option may be to try and get on a combination of T4 and T3 thyroid medication to ensure optimization of thyroid function.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Wrapping it Up</h3>



<p>There definitely seems to be some connection between thyroid patients taking levothyroxine and their risk of developing certain cancers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That risk is out fully fleshed out, though, and it will require more research to completely figure out what is going on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely convinced the cancer risk seen in some patients is 100% associated with the use of levothyroxine but rather the impact that levothyroxine has on the body (for better or worse).&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are concerned about your own personal cancer risk then there are things that you can do right away to potentially help reduce that risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now I want to hear from you:</p>



<p><strong>Are you currently taking levothyroxine?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Were you aware of the connection between levothyroxine and cancer?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Are you thinking about switching thyroid medications?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Are you planning on making any changes to your lifestyle?&nbsp;</strong></p>

http://restartmed.com/rss,Maca and Your Thyroid: Harmful or Helpful?,"
<p>Tired of relying 100% on your thyroid medication as a support system for your thyroid?</p>



<p>If so, then it may be time to try some other more natural options.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One such option is that of nutrient-dense foods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Specific foods contain high numbers of ingredients and botanicals that can not only impact your thyroid but other systems and hormones in your body as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are lots of foods that can do this but the one I want to focus on today is maca root.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maca is a plant that comes for Peru which has been used to treat a variety of ailments and enhance vitality for centuries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to modern technology we can now easily import maca root powder all around the world to take advantage of these benefits that were previously only known to those who lived near where it was grown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s technically in the same family as cruciferous vegetables (such as broccoli, cabbage, and kale) which is why there is some controversy about it being used in thyroid patients (more on this below).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today I want to talk about the benefits of maca root and why you should consider using it if you have a thyroid problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ll also discuss some of the more controversial points surrounding maca root in thyroid patients, why it&rsquo;s not harmful (even though some people suggest it is), how to dose it correctly, and what sort of benefits you can expect to experience when using it, and much more.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Maca Root Powder And Your Thyroid: Why It&rsquo;s Great</h2>



<p>Maca powder and thyroid patients are a match made in heaven.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s why:</p>



<p>Many of the symptoms that thyroid patients face on a daily basis happen to the benefits that maca provides.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Documented benefits of maca root powder include:</p>



<ul><li><em>Increase in&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6494062/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>libido, sex drive</em></a>&nbsp;(1)<em>, and fertility</em></li><li><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33729250/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Energy enhancing effects</em></a>&nbsp;(2)</li><li><em>Improved&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20616517/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>bone health</em></a>&nbsp;(3)</li><li><em>Better&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24931003/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>brain function</em></a>&nbsp;(4)</li><li><em>Cortisol&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3614644/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>balancing effects</em></a>&nbsp;(5)</li><li><em>Enhanced stress resilience</em></li><li><em>Better all-around vitality and sense of well-being</em></li></ul>



<p>As a thyroid patient, many of these benefits probably sound appealing because they may be issues you are dealing with as you read this.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-fatigue/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Fatigue</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/low-sex-drive-women/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">decreased sex drive</a>, bone loss,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/brain-fog-hashimotos/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">brain fog</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/adrenal-fatigue-symptoms/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">adrenal fatigue</a>, and so on, all commonly go hand in hand with thyroid disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using maca as a supplement provides an additional way to manage these symptoms and can be safely combined with&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-medication/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid medication</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not quite as easy as taking maca, reaping all of the benefits, and calling it a day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are some other additional ingredients found inside this plant that may cause issues for thyroid patients.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>What About Goitrogens?</h3>



<p>I mentioned that there is some controversy about using maca root powder if you have a thyroid problem and this is why.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;ve spent time around my blog then you will be familiar with the term&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/goitrogens/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">goitrogen</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Goitrogen is a term used to describe a compound or substance which blocks the uptake of iodine into the thyroid gland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The compounds and substances which do this can be found in all sorts of things ranging from&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK285560/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">chemicals</a>&nbsp;(6) to&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK285556/table/tyd-iodine-deficienc.goitrogenm/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">foods</a>&nbsp;(7) to supplements and even medications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lots of things have the potential to act as a goitrogen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can imagine that as a thyroid patient you may want to avoid goitrogenic compounds, right?</p>



<p>After all, getting iodine into your thyroid gland is pretty important if you want to produce thyroid hormone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, yes, and no.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In general, it&rsquo;s a good idea to avoid goitrogenic compounds if possible but it&rsquo;s not as straightforward as you might think.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember when I mentioned that maca root is in the same family as cruciferous vegetables?</p>



<p>Well, this is important because even though&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/cruciferous-vegetables-fact-sheet"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">cruciferous vegetables</a>&nbsp;(8) can have a goitrogenic effect on your thyroid gland doesn&rsquo;t mean their downsides outweigh their benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In most cases, and for most thyroid patients, the benefits you get from eating things like cabbage, kale, and broccoli outweigh any small potential problem that the goitrogens found in these vegetables may cause to your thyroid gland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This same principle holds true for maca root powder but even if this isn&rsquo;t enough for you, there are still several other reasons not to be concerned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s elaborate on this idea.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine you are taking maca root powder because you want to balance your sex hormones, enhance your libido, and increase your energy levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now let&rsquo;s say that taking maca is helping you experience all of these positive side effects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do you think that it makes sense to stop taking it just because you are worried that it MIGHT cause an issue with your thyroid?</p>



<p>Not really.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why trade something that is working right now for some problem that may never materialize.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that&rsquo;s not the whole story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though maca root may contain goitrogens doesn&rsquo;t mean there aren&rsquo;t ways to reduce the goitrogenic compounds found inside of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It turns out that the standard processing of maca root into a powder reduces most goitrogens!</p>



<p>If you were to eat maca root raw then, yes, you may experience some issues from its goitrogenic compounds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this isn&rsquo;t how it&rsquo;s normally prepared and eaten in Peru.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And when maca root powder is&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.themacateam.com/gelatinized-maca-powder-how-its-different"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">heated and gelatinized</a>, a significant portion of these goitrogenic compounds are neutralized making it very safe to consume for thyroid patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s not stop there, though, as we can take it one step further.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if you were to suppose that maca contains goitrogens, that still isn&rsquo;t a big problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Because you can outcompete goitrogens with the use of iodine!</p>



<p>Just because goitrogens block the uptake of iodine into the thyroid gland doesn&rsquo;t mean they block ALL iodine uptake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By consuming more iodine you can ensure that there is sufficient iodine uptake into your thyroid gland even in the presence of goitrogens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this very thing is probably happening in many of you day to day which is why you don&rsquo;t really ever have to give goitrogens a second thought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As long as you are consuming a&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/is-using-iodine-safe/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">healthy dose of iodine</a>&nbsp;each day you can be sure that that iodine gets where it needs to go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This idea of increasing your iodine intake when consuming goitrogens is something you will want to be familiar with as a thyroid patient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since there&rsquo;s no way to 100% avoid all goitrogens, ensuring a daily dose of iodine in the range of&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/high-dose-iodine/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">150mcg to 300mcg</a>&nbsp;is a smart idea.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bottom line?</p>



<p>You don&rsquo;t need to worry about goitrogens in maca unless you are eating it raw. If you consume a gelatinized version then most of the goitrogen compounds have already been removed. If you are still worried then simply bump up your daily dose of iodine and you are set. This allows you to get all of the benefits without the negative side effects.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Can Maca Interfere With Thyroid Medication?</h3>



<p>Yes and no.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just about&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/how-and-when-to-take-thyroid-supplements-for-maximum-benefit/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">every single supplement</a>&nbsp;on the planet has the potential to interfere with your thyroid medication if it&rsquo;s taken at the exact same time as your thyroid medication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is why you should always take your thyroid medication on an&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/how-to-take-your-thyroid-medication/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">empty stomach and with a glass of water</a>!</p>



<p>If you do this then you can prevent a lot of the issues that thyroid patients experience when it comes to thyroid medication absorption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This applies to all thyroid medications, by the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there&rsquo;s more to this story as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taking maca root may have an impact on other hormones in your body such as&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3614596/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">estrogen</a>&nbsp;(9),&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/low-progesterone-symptoms/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">progesterone</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/low-testosterone-women/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">testosterone</a>, and&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/cortisol-test/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">cortisol</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class=""gb-block-image gb-block-image-fae8ce08""><a href=""https://www.restartmed.com/shop/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""400"" height=""350"" class=""gb-image gb-image-fae8ce08"" src=""https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3.jpg"" alt=""join 80000 thyroid patients"" title=""join 80000 thyroid patients"" srcset=""https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3.jpg 400w, https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3-300x263.jpg 300w, https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3-69x60.jpg 69w, https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3-103x90.jpg 103w"" sizes=""(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"" data-pin-media=""https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3.jpg""></a></figure>



<p>Because these hormones are indirectly linked to thyroid function, there is a scenario in which taking maca root may impact your dose of thyroid medication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this could be reflected as a change in your thyroid hormone lab tests such as your&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/tsh-levels-normal/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">TSH level</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/free-t3/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">free T3 level</a>, and&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/free-t4-normal-range/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">free T4 level</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now it&rsquo;s unlikely that this would happen (I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;ve seen it personally) but there is a theoretical chance that it could.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if it did, though, that wouldn&rsquo;t be a cause for concern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much of my website is&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/blog/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">dedicated to helping thyroid patients</a>&nbsp;use as little thyroid medication as possible while still optimizing thyroid function.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised that as you naturally treat your body that your need for thyroid medication is minimized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s a great sign! And it indicates that whatever you are doing is working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, yes, maca may impact your thyroid medication dose and thyroid lab tests but this would generally be considered a good thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, it is also possible that raw maca may negatively impact your thyroid lab tests (by making them worse) due to its goitrogenic effects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This would only happen if you consume large amounts of the raw version without appropriate changes to your iodine intake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But because maca has the potential to impact your thyroid lab tests it would be a good idea to keep an eye on them if you decide to supplement with it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you wanted to be on the safe side then you could simply check your thyroid lab tests after 2-3 months of daily maca use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you find an abrupt&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/hypothyroidism-symptoms-checklist/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">change in your symptoms</a>&nbsp;(for better or worse) then you may want to pull the trigger and check them earlier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, I&rsquo;ve never personally seen any thyroid patients react in a negative way when using maca.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Does Maca Have Any Side Effects?</h3>



<p>Because maca is really just a plant/food, it is very well tolerated by most people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, there will be some people who don&rsquo;t tolerate it for various reasons but the majority of people who use maca root powder will either notice positive side effects or no significant change in how they are feeling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that&rsquo;s been consistent with my own experience in recommending and using maca personally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most people notice improvement within a few weeks of using it or they won&rsquo;t notice any changes and will simply stop taking it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But because it is a food, there&rsquo;s always a small chance that you will be intolerant to it or have an adverse reaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some foods, such as dairy products, seem to cause more problems than others, and I would put maca more on the side of foods that tend to be well tolerated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, you really don&rsquo;t have to worry about negative side effects while using maca.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if you are the kind of person that likes to check out research studies, there are&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3184420/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">some</a>&nbsp;(10) that suggest the same thing.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Does Maca Contain Iodine?</h3>



<p>Yes, maca contains a small amount of iodine in each serving.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve seen different numbers and different estimates for the iodine content of maca root so it&rsquo;s hard to give exact numbers but it&rsquo;s estimated that each teaspoon of maca root powder has around 20 to 25mcg of iodine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Put into perspective, you would need to consume 10 teaspoons of maca root powder to get around 200-225mcg of iodine per day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you were paying attention then you know that the daily recommended intake for iodine is around 150 to 300mcg of iodine per day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So even with a massive dose of maca, you are right in the middle of this recommended dose range.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The standard dose of maca is around 1-3 teaspoons.</p>



<p>Using this standard dose and the estimated iodine intake listed above, each serving of maca root powder would give you about 20-25 mcg of iodine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Certainly not enough to have a huge impact on your thyroid and probably the exact amount you need to outcompete any lingering goitrogens found in the maca itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bottom line:</p>



<p>Each serving of maca root contains a small amount of iodine but not enough to cause issues.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Will Maca Impact Your Libido?</h3>



<p>It may!</p>



<p>There are many reasons to take maca and one of those is its impact on libido or sexual desire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Female sexual desire is not something that gets talked about&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3008577/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">nearly enough</a>&nbsp;(11) but it is something that many women with thyroid disease experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The benefits of sexual intimacy are incredible but it&rsquo;s hard to experience these benefits when your sex drive is near zero.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Women with thyroid disease are more prone to developing decreased libido for a variety of reasons including depression, fatigue, changes to sex hormones, stress from their disease, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if you can, enhancing your libido for more sexual encounters is a great way to improve the overall health of your body and thyroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More sex means better blood pressure, heart health, mood, energy, pain control, hormone balance, sleep, and&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5052677/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">so on</a>&nbsp;(12).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The benefits read a lot like some cheap marketing pamphlets but they are well documented.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taking maca root is one way to naturally&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6494062/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">enhance your sexual desire</a>&nbsp;(13) which allows for more sexual encounters with your spouse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These benefits likely stem from the impact maca has on your sex hormones but it&rsquo;s not known exactly why it occurs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Either way, consider it a positive side effect that may occur!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note, though, that it doesn&rsquo;t occur for everyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both men and women take maca root powder to enhance sex drive but not everyone will see improvement, unfortunately.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Ashwagandha vs Maca for Thyroid Patients</h3>



<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/ashwagandha/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Ashwagandha</a>&nbsp;and maca root are different but they do share some similarities which is why they are sometimes compared to one another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ashwagandha is also a botanical and an adaptogen which means it too has an impact on cortisol levels, vitality, stress resilience, and fatigue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just like maca, ashwagandha has been used for centuries to treat a variety of ailments and medical conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And just like maca, there is some controversy about the safety of ashwagandha in thyroid patients!</p>



<p>And, again, just like maca, most of those concerns are overblown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ashwagandha is generally very well tolerated and has the backing of many&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28829155/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">research studies</a>&nbsp;(14) showing how efficacious it can be, even for thyroid patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to adaptogens, you will find that some botanicals are better at treating certain symptoms and conditions compared to others even though there is a lot of overlap between them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the case of maca vs ashwagandha, I would think about choosing maca if you notice that you have more issues with things like low sex drive, hormone imbalances, menstrual problems, difficulty building muscle mass, PCOS-like symptoms, fertility issues, and issues with vitality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If on the other hand, you were more interested in balancing cortisol levels, improving your sleep, obtaining more energy, supporting the thyroid-pituitary connection, managing depression/anxiety, and managing stress, then ashwagandha may make more sense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But don&rsquo;t get too hung up on the differences between these amazing botanicals because they have a lot of overlap between them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though maca may be better for libido doesn&rsquo;t mean that ashwagandha won&rsquo;t help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or just because ashwagandha tends to be better at improving energy doesn&rsquo;t mean maca won&rsquo;t do the same.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can think about these adaptogens as complementary to one another which means that you can take one or the other or both at the same time.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Will Maca Increase Estrogen?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Some women are concerned that using maca may raise their estrogen levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a legitimate concern because we suspect that maca definitely has some impact on testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And because many women with thyroid disease suffer from the symptoms of estrogen dominance, they are worried that maca may make those symptoms even worse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there are a couple of reasons why you don&rsquo;t need to worry about that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first is that botanicals typically show very little impact on serum hormone levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This applies to&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-supplements/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid support supplements</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/testosterone-supplements/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">testosterone support supplements</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/estrogen-supplements/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">estrogen support supplements</a>, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though they can certainly impact symptoms, they typically do not have a huge impact on serum levels of whatever hormone level they are influencing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, you could take a maca supplement for low estrogen and experience relief in some of your low estrogen symptoms without seeing a rise in serum estradiol levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There haven&rsquo;t been a ton of studies on humans which show that maca has a profound impact on&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18784609/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">serum estrogen levels</a>&nbsp;(15).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second reason not to worry is that botanicals and adaptogens tend to work via a variety of mechanisms that result in hormone balance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Put another way, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter if your estrogen is high or low because the supplement helps bring that value back to normal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If it&rsquo;s high then it helps bring it lower and if it&rsquo;s low then it helps bring it higher and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For these reasons, taking maca in the setting of high estrogen or estrogen dominance is not usually an issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may not tolerate maca for other reasons but it&rsquo;s most likely not because it will raise your estrogen or make your estrogen dominance worse.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>How Much Maca Should you Take &amp; What Type?</h3>



<p>In order to avoid potential issues, you will want to look for maca as gelatinized maca root powder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This gelatinization process is what helps remove the goitrogenic compounds and makes consuming maca very safe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Avoid any form of raw maca or unprocessed maca unless you are planning to heat and prepare it on your own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I typically recommend getting maca as organic maca root powder in its gelatinized form.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This allows you to safely add maca to a morning smoothie or a thyroid-friendly protein powder (a quick and easy way to get it into your system!).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But maca does have a sort of nutty taste to it which can change the flavor of whatever you put it into.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If that is a problem for you then you may look to supplements or capsules to get your daily dose of maca.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It gets a little bit tricky when you go this route because sometimes supplement manufacturers will use the raw source instead of the gelatinized source to reduce the cost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you want to use maca in a supplement form just make sure that you double-check with the manufacturer to ensure it&rsquo;s not in the raw form!&nbsp;</p>



<p>How much should you take?</p>



<p>The recommended dose is around 1 teaspoon per day or around 3 grams of maca powder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s safe to consume more than that, though, and I personally use around 1 tablespoon each day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just make sure that you start low at around the 1 teaspoon dose and increase as tolerated up to a level that you feel comfortable with.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>How Long Does it Take Maca to Work?</h3>



<p>It really depends!</p>



<p>Sometimes men and women who take maca notice results almost instantly and within a few days whereas it may take several weeks for others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because maca is an adaptogen, you should plan to give it around 6 weeks to take effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Supplements that fall into the grouping of adaptogens can take a while to really kick in because they are attempting to influence hormone function.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in order to see improvement from changes in hormone function, you need to give your body enough time for those changes to take place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For adrenal and thyroid supplements, that amount of time is usually around 6 weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But you may see some improvement in other areas much sooner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, some people who use maca see an almost immediate improvement in symptoms such as decreased sex drive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other benefits such as more energy, better sleep, more stress resilience, and improved fertility, will probably take weeks to months.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>



<p>Maca root powder is a great supplement that can help manage many of the symptoms that thyroid patients deal with on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As long as you find maca in its correct form you don&rsquo;t need to worry about it interfering with your thyroid function.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taking maca daily can help with a variety of issues and many people use it for its benefits on sex hormones, sexual health, fertility, energy, and vitality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now I want to hear from you:</p>



<p><strong>Are you currently taking maca root powder?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Are you taking it in supplement form or in powder form?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Are you planning on trying it after reading this article?</strong></p>

<h2>Supplements and Medications Can Impact Your Thyroid Medication</h2>



<p>Million and millions of thyroid patients are taking levothyroxine to support their thyroid every single month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many of them, may not be taking it correctly.</p>



<p>Thyroid medication is one of those medications that looks for just about any reason to not get absorbed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And for you as a thyroid patient that is a big problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After all, the whole point of taking thyroid medication is to increase your thyroid hormone to bring your thyroid back to normal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your medication isn&rsquo;t getting absorbed or used by your body then you won&rsquo;t feel better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The good news is that there are a few simple things that you can do to make sure that your medication is getting into your body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of those things is to avoid taking it with other supplements (and medications) that can cause problems!</p>



<p>Calcium is one such ingredient.</p>



<p>It is well known that taking calcium near the time that you take your thyroid medication can limit how much gets absorbed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today we are going to discuss this process in more detail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll learn:</p>



<ul><li><em>How calcium interferes with thyroid medication</em></li><li><em>Why you must take calcium supplements (and foods that contain calcium) at least 4 hours away from whenever you take your thyroid medication</em></li><li><em>More about the obvious and not-so-obvious sources of calcium (how you may be consuming it without realizing it)</em></li><li><em>Why food sources of calcium can still cause issues</em></li><li><em>How to take calcium supplements and thyroid medication together safely</em></li><li><em>Why calcium supplements may not be the best way to improve bone health and other alternatives to consider</em></li></ul>

<h2>The Effect of Calcium on Thyroid Medications</h2>



<p>Hypothyroidism is a disease that predominately impacts women.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Women also happen to be the gender most at risk for bone loss.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And because many women around the age of perimenopause and menopause have both thyroid disease and bone loss, problems can start to arise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These women are often told to start supplementing with calcium when they go in for their periodic DEXA scan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DEXA scan helps to&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/10683-dexa-dxa-scan-bone-density-test"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">assess bone density</a>&nbsp;(1) and is often the first way women hear about their bone density status.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your DEXA scan shows that you have some bone loss you will likely be told to start supplementing with extra calcium to try and prevent further issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a thyroid problem then that&rsquo;s probably the end of your story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if you do have a thyroid problem and you are taking a thyroid medication like levothyroxine (or any other), then that&rsquo;s where problems can arise!</p>



<p>What does calcium do when taken with thyroid medication?</p>



<p>It binds to the thyroid hormone found in the thyroid medication and&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3092723/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">renders it inactive</a>&nbsp;(2).&nbsp;</p>



<p>It turns it into an insoluble or nonabsorbable complex which then gets eliminated in the stool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means that if you take your thyroid medication within several hours of when you took a calcium supplement, there&rsquo;s a chance that some of that thyroid medication will be rendered inactive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a big problem for you because you need that thyroid hormone to get into your body to help with things like&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-fatigue/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">energy</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-hair-loss/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">hair growth</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/metabolism-thyroid-hormone/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">metabolism</a>, heart rate, hormone balance, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if you were to take a calcium supplement and your thyroid medication at the same time (which isn&rsquo;t recommended) not all of your thyroid medication would be rendered inactive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only a fraction of it wouldn&rsquo;t make it into your body and into your cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But even if you limit the absorption of your medication by 10-30% that can still be a big deal in terms of its impact on your symptoms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Often small changes to thyroid medication dosing can have a profound impact on how you feel day to day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So you want to do everything in your power to make sure 100% of your thyroid medication gets into your body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do you do this?&nbsp;</p>



<p>By separating when you take your thyroid medication and calcium supplements by as much time as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The magic number is at least 4 hours apart.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I will go over some additional details to help you understand how to take your thyroid medication below so stick around for those helpful tips.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>TSH Suppression and Calcium Supplements</h2>



<p>There&rsquo;s one other group of thyroid patients that needs to be addressed before we move on to sources of calcium and that&rsquo;s the group of thyroid patients with&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/low-tsh-vs-suppressed-tsh-on-thyroid-medication/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">suppressed TSH</a>&nbsp;levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A suppressed TSH just means that your TSH level is undetectable when you test for it and will usually be recorded as&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/tsh-levels-normal/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">some value less than another value</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, it will be represented as something like &lt;0.004 uIU/mL.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a potential issue because a suppressed TSH&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7424360/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">slightly increases your risk of osteoporosis</a>&nbsp;(3) and this effect is compounded if you are in&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5643776/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">menopause</a>&nbsp;(4).&nbsp;</p>



<figure class=""gb-block-image gb-block-image-9744b744""><a href=""https://www.restartmed.com/shop/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""400"" height=""350"" class=""gb-image gb-image-9744b744"" src=""https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3.jpg"" alt=""join 80000 thyroid patients"" title=""join 80000 thyroid patients"" srcset=""https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3.jpg 400w, https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3-300x263.jpg 300w, https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3-69x60.jpg 69w, https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3-103x90.jpg 103w"" sizes=""(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"" data-pin-media=""https://www.restartmed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-in-content-ad-for-supplements-3.jpg""></a></figure>



<p>The combination of menopause and a suppressed TSH means that you are much more likely than the average thyroid patient to experience bone loss or osteoporosis which means increasing calcium intake is usually important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, because most patients with a suppressed TSH are doing so for purposes of preventing&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28960722/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">cancer recurrence</a>&nbsp;(5), it&rsquo;s also important that your dose of thyroid medication is not impeded!</p>



<p>If your TSH is suppressed then you need it suppressed and you have to juggle two things simultaneously:</p>



<ul><li><em>The need to keep your TSH suppressed with thyroid medication</em></li><li><em>And the need to support your bones to prevent osteoporosis</em></li></ul>



<p>For this group of patients, it&rsquo;s very important that calcium is taken correctly so as to avoid any issues with thyroid medication absorption.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Obvious and Not So Obvious Sources of Calcium</h2>



<p>Calcium is a mineral that your body stores in both the&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6683260/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">bones and the teeth</a>&nbsp;(6) and is found in several different forms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the purposes of this article, you should be aware that all forms of calcium have shown to interfere with thyroid medication including calcium carbonate, calcium citrate, and calcium acetate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They may differ slightly in how severely they impact thyroid medication absorption but they all can cause the same issue:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Binding and inactivating thyroid hormone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this appears to include food sources of calcium as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29589994/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">study</a>&nbsp;(7) illustrated this point by comparing thyroid patients taking their thyroid medication with and without a glass of milk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thyroid patients who took their thyroid medication without milk showed higher T4 levels when tested which suggested that the calcium found in cow&rsquo;s milk was enough to limit some absorption of their medication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For this reason, you should avoid taking your thyroid medication anywhere near any source of calcium including foods, supplements, and medications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You are probably aware of the obvious sources of calcium but are you aware that calcium is often hidden in some medications and supplements?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is a list of potential sources of calcium to make sure that it doesn&rsquo;t sneak into your diet without you knowing it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Foods high in calcium&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/calcium-content-of-foods"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">include</a>&nbsp;(8):</p>



<ul><li><em>Dairy products &ndash; Milk, yogurt, cheese, etc.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Soybeans</em></li><li><em>Dark green and leafy vegetables &ndash; Kale, spinach, collard greens.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Calcium-fortified foods such as orange juice &ndash; Look for claims of extra calcium on the packaging!</em></li><li><em>Beans and lentils</em></li><li><em>Figs</em></li><li><em>Sardines and Salmon</em></li><li><em>Almonds</em></li><li><em>Whey protein</em></li></ul>



<p>These foods don&rsquo;t contain calcium levels equal to that of calcium supplements but any source of calcium has a small potential to impact your thyroid medication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For comparison, calcium supplements typically contain 500-1,000mg of calcium, and one cup of milk contains about 325mg of calcium.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s close but not quite the same as a pure calcium supplement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless, though, it&rsquo;s still safer to avoid eating foods high in calcium around the time that you take your thyroid medication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obvious sources of calcium include:</p>



<ul><li><em>Calcium supplements</em></li></ul>



<p>These are dedicated calcium supplements that most likely have the name calcium branded all over them.</p>



<p>Not so obvious sources of calcium include:</p>



<ul><li><em>Multivitamins</em></li><li><em>Antacids for indigestion</em></li><li><em>Prescription medications and over-the-counter medications</em></li></ul>



<p>A good rule of thumb is to check all of our supplements and medications for hidden sources of calcium.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can do this by either calling your pharmacy for information about your medications (including fillers and binders) or by looking at the supplement fact panel on the back of your supplement.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Calcium Supplements and Their Impact on Cytomel, Liothyronine, and NDT</h2>



<p>What if you aren&rsquo;t taking standard thyroid medications like&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/levothyroxine-dosage/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">levothyroxine</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/synthroid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Synthroid</a>?</p>



<p>Well, the information still applies!</p>



<p>While we don&rsquo;t have as many studies showing a negative impact on other medications, we still have reason to believe that calcium can inhibit these other thyroid medications as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For this reason, the recommended advice of waiting 4 hours between taking thyroid medication and calcium applies to all thyroid medications including:</p>



<ul><li><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/liothyronine/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Liothyronine</em></a></li><li><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/cytomel-side-effects/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Cytomel</em></a></li><li><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/naturethroid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Nature-throid</em></a></li><li><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/wp-thyroid-weight-loss/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>WP Thyroid</em></a></li><li><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/np-thyroid-vs-armour-thyroid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>NP Thyroid</em></a></li><li><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/armour-thyroid-weight-loss/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Armour Thyroid</em></a></li><li><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/tirosint-beats-levothyroxine/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Tirosint</em></a></li><li><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/tirosint-sol/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Tirosint-Sol</em></a></li><li><em>Levoxyl</em></li><li><em>Other formulations of NDT</em></li><li><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/sustained-release-t3/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>SR T3</em></a></li><li><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/compounded-thyroid-medication/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Compounded T4 and T3 medications</em></a></li><li><em>And all&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-medication-names/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>other thyroid medications</em></a><em>&nbsp;and formulations</em></li></ul>



<p>The reason is simple:</p>



<p>Even though these medications differ in names and hormone content they still all contain bioidentical thyroid hormones which means that these hormones still may be bound to by calcium.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Need to Take Calcium? Here&rsquo;s How to Take it so Doesn&rsquo;t Impact Your Thyroid</h2>



<p>As mentioned above, you want to make sure that if you are taking calcium (from any source, food, or supplements) you take it at least 4 hours away from whenever you take your thyroid medication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some thyroid patients often get confused because they&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.restartmed.com/take-levothyroxine/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">wrongly believe</a> that they must take their thyroid medication at some specific time of the day (usually in the morning).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The truth is that you can take your thyroid medication at any time of the day, including in the evening.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, some studies show that taking thyroid medication at night may be&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21149757/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">better</a>&nbsp;(10) than taking it in the morning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Understanding this gives you some wiggle room and can help you take your calcium as far away from your thyroid medication as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, a good strategy may be to take your calcium supplements in the morning and your thyroid medication in the evening (or vice versa).&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have to take your thyroid medication in the morning and prefer to take your calcium with a meal (because maybe it hurts your stomach if you don&rsquo;t) then make sure it&rsquo;s split by at least 4 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you take your calcium supplement at 7:00 am then you will want to take your thyroid medication at 11:00 am at the soonest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you take your thyroid medication at 7:00 am then you will want to take your calcium supplement at 11:00 am at the soonest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make sense?</p>



<p>Good!</p>



<p>In addition to these rules, here are some additional helpful tips to make your thyroid medication more effective:</p>



<ul><li><em>Never take your thyroid medication at the same time as any other prescription medication or over-the-counter supplement (even if it doesn&rsquo;t contain calcium).&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>If you are taking a calcium supplement then take your thyroid medication 4 hours away (either before or after)</em></li><li><em>If you are taking an&nbsp;</em><a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9191742/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>iron supplement</em></a>&nbsp;(10)<em>&nbsp;then take your thyroid medication 4 hours away (either before or after)</em></li><li><em>Most&nbsp;</em><a href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-supplements/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>other supplements</em></a><em>&nbsp;can be taken 30-60 minutes away from whenever you take your thyroid medication with the exception of iron and calcium.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Take your thyroid medication with only water!&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Avoid taking your thyroid medication with&nbsp;</em><a href=""https://www.restartmed.com/coffee-and-synthroid/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>coffee</em></a><em>, milk, or any other liquid that isn&rsquo;t water.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Try taking your thyroid medication in the evening on an empty stomach right before you go to bed.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Consider switching to a different type of thyroid medication such as Tirosint or Tirosint-Sol.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Stay consistent with the time that you take your thyroid medication (take it at the&nbsp;</em><a href=""https://www.restartmed.com/how-to-take-your-thyroid-medication/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>same time every single day</em></a><em>!)</em></li></ul>



<p>These tips and tricks will not only prevent issues with calcium and other supplements but they can also help prevent absorption issues from other things such as food, liquids, medications, and other supplements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember:</p>



<p>When in doubt, take your thyroid medication away from everything else!</p>



<h2>Consider Alternatives to Calcium for Bone Health</h2>



<p>Even though calcium supplements are frequently recommended for treating bone health, they may not be as beneficial as you think.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many physicians, doctors, and&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/calcium-supplements-should-you-take-them"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">experts</a>&nbsp;(me included) recommend getting your calcium from natural sources as much as possible as opposed to using over-the-counter calcium supplements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s actually a fair amount of controversy over calcium supplements, vitamin D, vitamin K2, and bone health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I won&rsquo;t get deep into the controversy except to highlight a few points.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first is that there is some evidence to suggest that calcium found in food is more bioavailable (better absorbed) compared to the calcium found in supplements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, getting your calcium from food sources may be preferred.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, calcium really doesn&rsquo;t do much on its own because other nutrients are necessary to deliver the calcium to where it needs to go so that it can do its job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vitamins that help facilitate the function of calcium in the bones include&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.restartmed.com/vitamin-d-thyroid/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">vitamin D</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4566462/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">vitamin K2</a>&nbsp;(11).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some providers believe that taking calcium without vitamin D and K2 may be a waste and may even cause more harm than good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can simplify this controversy by making some general recommendations:</p>



<ul><li><em>If you need more calcium try to get that calcium from food as much as possible.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>If you do decide to use a calcium supplement then make sure your&nbsp;</em><a href=""https://www.restartmed.com/vitamin-d-and-hashimotos/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>vitamin D level is optimized</em></a><em>&nbsp;and consider taking vitamin K2 with it.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Make sure you are putting physical pressure on your bones with weight-bearing exercises (this allows you to take advantage of&nbsp;</em><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4556408/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Wolff&rsquo;s law</em></a>&nbsp;(12)<em>).&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>No matter what you decide to do, make sure you take your thyroid medication as far away from any source of calcium as possible.&nbsp;</em></li></ul>



<h2>Wrapping it up</h2>



<p>Calcium is known to cause problems for thyroid patients because it interferes with thyroid medication absorption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This interference applies to all thyroid medications and appears to stem from just about any source of calcium including medications, supplements, and even food sources.</p>



<p>If you are a thyroid patient taking thyroid medication then you should be aware of calcium&rsquo;s potential negative impact!&nbsp;</p>



<p>You should also be aware of the potential sources of calcium so you can actively try to avoid them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you feel that you need extra calcium to support bone health then a better way of getting your calcium may be from natural food sources instead of supplements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Food sources of calcium can still cause issues for thyroid medication absorption, though, so keep that in mind if you try to increase your intake of calcium-rich foods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now I want to hear from you:</p>



<p><strong>Were you aware of the impact that calcium has on thyroid medication?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Did you know that this problem applies to all forms and versions of thyroid medications?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Are you taking a calcium supplement to support bone health?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Do you feel it&rsquo;s working for you? Why or why not?</strong></p>

<h2>Why Thousands of Thyroid Patients Use Thyroid Support Supplements</h2>



<p>Look, I&rsquo;m definitely a little bit biased here because I sell&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/shop/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid supplements</a>&nbsp;(over 70,000+ thyroid patients have used them to date) but I always get a chuckle when I hear how conventional doctors talk about them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On one hand, they will tell you that they don&rsquo;t work, they are a waste of your money, and that you should never take them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other, they will tell you that they are unregulated, that they will interfere with your&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.medstarhealth.org/blog/thyroid-supplements"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid medication</a>, and that they will make you&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.webmd.com/women/news/20111028/study-thyroid-support-supplements-may-be-risky"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">feel worse</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first situation implies that they don&rsquo;t work at all while the other implies that they are too powerful to be controlled.</p>



<p>So which is it?</p>



<p>Well, it all depends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As usual, there is some truth to what your doctor is telling you but it&rsquo;s not the whole truth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are some thyroid support supplements that can lead to problems and there are others that may not help you at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether they work or not depends on what type of thyroid support supplement you are taking, the ingredients in the supplement, the quality of the manufacturing process, and where they were manufactured.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you get the right type of thyroid support supplement then, yes, there is a chance that you will see improvement in how you are feeling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you use the wrong one or a low-quality cheap thyroid support supplement, well, then, yes, you are probably just throwing your money away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key is to use the right one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But to suggest that all thyroid support supplements are harmful or dangerous is just silly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And when you look at the numbers, you will see why.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are literally hundreds of thousands of thyroid patients who purchase thyroid support supplements on a monthly basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may even be one of them if you are reading this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do you really think hundreds of thousands of thyroid patients continually buy things that don&rsquo;t work or don&rsquo;t provide any benefit?</p>



<p>I don&rsquo;t either.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I trust that when a thyroid patient purchases a supplement and then continues to buy it over and over again that they are getting some benefit from it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s been my experience and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve seen over the years as I&rsquo;ve helped thousands of thyroid patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But doctors aren&rsquo;t all wrong.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There can be some side effects associated with thyroid support supplements so let&rsquo;s discuss those in more detail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today you will learn:</p>

<h2>List of Thyroid Supplement Side Effects to Watch out For:</h2>



<p>Whenever you take anything, whether that be a supplement or a medication, you should be thinking about side effects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Side effects aren&rsquo;t always bad, by the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you take ibuprofen for a headache, for instance, the side effect you are looking for is a relief in your pain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What you aren&rsquo;t looking for is an&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526078/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">upset stomach</a>&nbsp;(1), which can certainly come when taking NSAIDs like ibuprofen on an empty stomach.</p>



<p>This same logic applies to thyroid supplements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You are taking them because you want to feel better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You want to have&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-fatigue/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">more energy</a>, you want to&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-weight-loss/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">lose weight</a>, you want your&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-hair-loss/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">hair to grow</a>, you want your brain fog to lift, you want to&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/hypothyroidism-and-depression/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">feel happier</a>, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thyroid patients are drawn to thyroid support supplements because their medication doesn&rsquo;t always&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/signs-your-thyroid-medication-is-too-low/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">take away their low thyroid symptoms</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So people go out looking for alternatives and then land on thyroid support supplements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is perfectly fine as long as those supplements give you what you want while also avoiding the side effects that you don&rsquo;t want.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this in mind, let&rsquo;s talk about some potential good side effects of thyroid supplements before we talk about the bad ones.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Positive Side Effects</h3>



<p>Because your thyroid helps to control and regulate just about every cell in your body, the impact that boosting thyroid function has on your body is pretty broad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, two people can take the exact same supplement and experience completely different benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Because no two people with thyroid disease are exactly alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your symptoms will differ from the next person and that&rsquo;s completely fine and normal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some potential good side effects you may experience while taking thyroid supplements include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><em>More energy (very common)</em></li><li><em>Reduced brain fog</em></li><li><em>Some weight loss</em></li><li><em>Reduced hair fall and/or new hair growth</em></li><li><em>Warmer body temperature</em></li><li><em>Improved resting heart rate</em></li><li><em>Lighter mood</em></li><li><em>Improved sense of well-being (you just feel better overall)</em></li><li><em>Reduced joint pain and/or muscle aches</em></li><li><em>More regular menstrual cycle</em></li></ul>



<p>The presence of these side effects indicates that your thyroid supplements are working and doing exactly what you want them to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, unfortunately, because not all thyroid supplements are created equal, you may end up feeling worse.</p>



<h3>Negative Side Effects</h3>



<p>Negative side effects occur when the supplements you are taking make your thyroid worse, cause a reaction in your body to a specific ingredient, or when they result in what is referred to as a&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557820/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">detox-like reaction</a>&nbsp;(2).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the time, these negative side effects are not a good sign and may mean that you need to change up what you are taking, try a new supplement, or recheck your thyroid gland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes, though, thyroid supplements can make you temporarily feel worse for a short period of time and this isn&rsquo;t a problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This occurs with the so-called detox-like reaction I mentioned above.&nbsp;</p>


<div class=""wp-block-image"">

<p>Sometimes taking powerful supplements can accelerate the release of things that you&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-detox/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">don&rsquo;t want in your body</a>&nbsp;(think chemicals or toxins) which can make you feel worse temporarily.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this is a good thing because you don&rsquo;t want those things there anyway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And sometimes, you just need to give your body time to acclimate to something new.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It can be hard to tease out sometimes which is why working with a professional is always ideal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some negative side effects that thyroid patients may experience when taking thyroid supplements:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><em>Headache</em></li><li><em>Worsening fatigue</em></li><li><em>Itching of the skin</em></li><li><em>Acne</em></li><li><em>Flushing or warm rushes</em></li><li><em>Uncomfortable heart palpitations</em></li><li><em>Tremors or shaking of the hands</em></li><li><em>Changes to your appetite</em></li><li><em>Sensitivity to heat</em></li><li><em>New rashes or hives</em></li><li><em>Raised body temperature or a slight fever</em></li><li><em>Shortness of breath</em></li><li><em>Decreased sense of well-being (feeling overall worse)</em></li><li><em>Indigestion or stomach pain</em></li><li><em>Changes to bowel movements</em></li></ul>



<p>The presence of these side effects indicates that your body is not tolerating your supplements very well and that they may be having a negative impact on your thyroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I mentioned above that sometimes you may feel worse before you feel better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If that&rsquo;s the case, your negative side effects will persist only for about 5-7 days which is the period it takes for your body to acclimate to your new supplements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are experiencing side effects that last longer than this, it&rsquo;s a good idea to stop taking whatever you are using and either try something new or give your body some time to readjust back to normal.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Preventing Negative Side Effects from Thyroid Supplements</h3>



<p>The key to taking thyroid supplements is to do whatever you can to enhance the positive side effects while decreasing or eliminating the chances of negative side effects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After all, what thyroid patient doesn&rsquo;t want to have more energy and feel better?</p>



<p>Most if not all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But they don&rsquo;t want to experience stomach aches, acne, or headaches in the process!&nbsp;</p>



<p>And no one is blaming them for that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By following the guidelines before you choose to purchase or buy a thyroid supplement, you will give your body the best chance it has to feel better (not worse).&nbsp;</p>



<h4>#1. Avoid Taking High Doses of Iodine</h4>



<p>One key ingredient that may cause problems in thyroid supplements is that of iodine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iodine is a&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/is-using-iodine-safe/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">critical and essential element</a>&nbsp;required for thyroid function so it makes sense that it is commonly found in these supplements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you consider that many thyroid patients are knowingly (and unknowingly) avoiding iodine, there is certainly a place for including it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem with iodine doesn&rsquo;t stem from the iodine itself but from the dose that you are taking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regular doses of iodine, found in the RDA range of about&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iodine-HealthProfessional/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">150 to 300mcg of iodine</a>&nbsp;(3) per day, are generally very safe and well-tolerated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But some thyroid supplements contain doses much higher than this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes you will find doses of iodine in the range of&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/high-dose-iodine/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">25mg or more</a>&nbsp;which is hundreds of times more potent than the recommended daily dose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Very high doses of iodine can cause a blockade of the uptake of thyroid hormone into your thyroid gland and may also precipitate autoimmune thyroid disease (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/what-is-graves-disease/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Graves&rsquo; disease</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/root-causes-of-hashimotos/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Hashimoto&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;have both been linked to very high doses of&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4404933/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">iodine</a>&nbsp;(4)).&nbsp;</p>



<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to avoid any thyroid supplement that has iodine but you should be aware of the dose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can check the supplement fact panel on the back of your supplement bottle to see if iodine is included.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If it is, you will see the type of iodine found as well as the dose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not always that simple.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because iodine is found in foods, your supplement may just state that it includes something like dulse or kelp.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iodine is naturally found in these sources but may not be included in the supplement fact panel if that&rsquo;s the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just be aware of this because sometimes thyroid supplements will contain kelp and may not state that iodine is in there even though it&rsquo;s found in the kelp.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you are first starting with thyroid support supplements aim to keep your iodine intake from all sources around 150 to 300mcg per day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will keep you out of trouble.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>#2. Avoid Unlabeled Thyroid Hormones</h4>



<p>The next thing you want to do is avoid taking unlabeled thyroid hormones that are sometimes found in thyroid support supplements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What do I mean by unlabeled thyroid hormones?</p>



<p>Exactly as it sounds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are 4 thyroid hormones that your body creates from the thyroid gland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>T1, T2, T3, and T4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>T3 and T4 thyroid hormones are considered prescription medications and are only available if your doctor writes you a prescription for something like&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/take-levothyroxine/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">levothyroxine</a>&nbsp;(T4) or&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/liothyronine/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">liothyronine</a>&nbsp;(T3).&nbsp;</p>



<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4272398/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">T2</a>&nbsp;(5) is available over the counter in supplement form and T1 isn&rsquo;t talked about much because we aren&rsquo;t exactly sure how important it is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>T1 and T2 are not as powerful as T4 and T3 which is why these are only available in a prescription.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because of how powerful T4 and T3 are, you really need to know exactly how much you are taking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23758055/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">studies</a>&nbsp;(6) have shown that many thyroid support supplements contain these powerful ingredients which are not labeled on the supplement fact panel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether this is done intentionally (to get away with providing a prescription quality supplement without FDA oversight) or unintentionally (because of poor manufacturing) isn&rsquo;t clear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we do know that taking these ingredients can be a problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&rsquo;m not against the idea that thyroid patients can learn and understand how to self-dose or self-titrate medication but it can become a big problem when you aren&rsquo;t told how much you are taking and if the dosing changes from one lot to another!</p>



<p>Taking unlabeled thyroid hormones can cause changes to your&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-testing/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid labs</a>, make dosing your prescription medications unpredictable, and lead to&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/hyperthyroid-symptoms-checklist-do-you-have-an-overactive-thyroid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">hyperthyroid symptoms</a>&nbsp;if you aren&rsquo;t careful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can avoid these ingredients by sticking to supplements that are manufactured in the United States and looking for manufacturers that third party test their ingredients for purity and ingredient content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This should help you stay safe and avoid taking an unknown amount of powerful thyroid hormone.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>#3. Don&rsquo;t Take Your Thyroid Supplements at the Same Time as Your Medication</h4>



<p>Next, you should be aware of the impact that thyroid supplements can have on your thyroid medication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not the medication itself but how well it is absorbed by your body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You should think about your thyroid medication and your thyroid supplements as complementary to one another and not as a replacement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thyroid supplements can help your thyroid medication work more effectively and they can pick up where medication is falling short.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to facilitate this, you better make sure you are&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/how-to-take-your-thyroid-medication/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">taking them both correctly</a>!</p>



<p>Lots of things can negatively impact&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6193522/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid medication absorption</a>&nbsp;(7) which is why you should always take your medication by itself (and never with your thyroid supplements).&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve found that taking thyroid support supplements 30 to 60 minutes away from your thyroid medication is sufficient as long as you aren&rsquo;t taking a calcium or an iron supplement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These ingredients should be taken 4 hours away from thyroid medication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you take your thyroid supplements and thyroid medication at the same time, you may feel worse because your thyroid medication is no longer working as effectively as it once did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This isn&rsquo;t the fault of the supplements necessarily, but more about how and when you are taking them.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>#4. Start Low and Go Slow</h4>



<p>Finally, because thyroid function is so important to your overall health, it&rsquo;s never a bad idea to take it slow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your thyroid helps to control and regulate many systems in the body and these systems all have an impact on how you are feeling day to day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For this reason, many doctors like to start out on small doses of thyroid medication and slowly increase your dose over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can apply this same principle to thyroid support supplements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if the recommended dose of your thyroid support supplement is 2 capsules per day there&rsquo;s nothing stopping you from starting with 1 capsule and increasing up to 2 capsules after a week or two.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When in doubt, start low and go slow with your thyroid supplement dose!&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>



<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer in the use of thyroid supplements because I&rsquo;ve seen them provide&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-supplements/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">tremendous benefits</a>&nbsp;to thousands of patients over the years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though they can be helpful, there are certainly some bad ones out there that can cause problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key to using thyroid supplements successfully is to avoid the ingredients that can cause problems, to take your supplements correctly, and never use them as a replacement for your thyroid medication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following these general principles should help you maximize positive side effects while minimizing negative side effects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now I want to hear from you:</p>



<p><strong>Are you currently taking thyroid supplements?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Are you experiencing any negative side effects? What about positive side effects?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Have you had a bad reaction in the past?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Does your doctor recommend using supplements or have they told you to stay away from them?</strong></p>

http://restartmed.com/rss,4 Big Causes of Weight Gain in Hashimoto’s,"
<h2>Why is it so Hard to Lose Weight with Hashimoto&rsquo;s?</h2>



<p>If you have Hashimoto&rsquo;s and you are gaining weight then stopping this weight gain should be your top priority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&rsquo;m not kidding when I say that weight gain in thyroid patients can cause a lot of distress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the impact that it has on your&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6052856/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">psychological well-being</a>&nbsp;(1) to the impact it has on your&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4386197/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">overall health</a>&nbsp;(2), managing your weight is very important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More so for patients that have Hashimoto&rsquo;s thyroiditis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Because losing weight and keeping it off is harder for patients who have&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/lose-weight-hashimotos/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid problems</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Losing weight is also more difficult if you are&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6282840/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">a woman</a>&nbsp;(3). And because Hashimoto&rsquo;s impacts&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24793874/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">women</a>&nbsp;(4) more than men, you have two things going against you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there is some good news:</p>



<p>Gaining weight with Hashimoto&rsquo;s is not some inevitable thing that has to happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, even if has already happened to you, doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t stop it or even lose the weight that you&rsquo;ve gained from your diagnosis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key is all about understanding the underlying cause of weight gain if you have a thyroid problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contrary to popular belief, it&rsquo;s not just about your calories or your diet (though these can play a role).&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit more complicated which is why we are going to be discussing it today.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>4 Reasons You are Gaining Weight</h2>



<p>If you were hoping to learn more about how to cut calories to help you lose weight then you&rsquo;ve come to the wrong place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Calorie restriction may be the preferred method for weight loss by endocrinologists, nutritionists, and some researchers, but it&rsquo;s not really going to help you much as a patient with Hashimoto&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having a thyroid problem changes everything.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your ability to manage your weight is more about&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/weight-loss-tips-for-thyroid-patients/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">hormone balance</a>&nbsp;than anything else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sooner you come to this realization the better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, calories are important and, yes, they do play a role, but their role is minor to the things we are about to discuss.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Calorie-restricted diets, such as those promoted by major weight loss brands and companies, can actually cause more harm than good for your thyroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just a few short weeks of cutting your calories on a daily basis is enough to slow down your thyroid,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16720655/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">lower T3</a>&nbsp;(5), increase&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1249190/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">reverse T3</a>&nbsp;(6), and slow down your&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5886711/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">metabolism</a>&nbsp;(7).&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll want to avoid this type of diet at all costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, focus on these 4 major causes of weight gain:&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#1. Low Thyroid Function from Thyroid Gland Damage</h3>



<p>The first and most obvious source of weight gain among patients with Hashimoto&rsquo;s is that of thyroid function.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to understand this connection, you have to understand the importance of thyroid hormone as it relates to your&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/metabolism-thyroid-hormone/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">metabolism</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your metabolism, or basal metabolic rate, represents the number of calories that you burn on basic day-to-day functions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ranging from things like eating to thinking to breathing, these calories are necessary for keeping you alive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your thyroid helps to regulate this number by impacting things like your heart rate, how much cellular energy you produce, and how much heat your body produces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patients with low thyroid function see a decline in their&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4044302/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">basal metabolic rate</a>&nbsp;(8) which results in several things:</p>



<ul><li><em>A decrease in their resting heart rate</em></li><li><em>A decrease in their body temperature</em></li><li><em>Weight gain due to a decrease in whole-body metabolism</em></li></ul>



<p>Just think about this for a minute:</p>



<p>If you are gaining weight because your metabolism has dropped, do you think that lowering your calories will solve that problem?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or does it make sense to focus on the root cause of the problem and bring your thyroid back to its normal function?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer is obvious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spend your time and energy on INCREASING your thyroid function back to whatever its normal was before you developed Hashimoto&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the single best and most important action you can take if you have Hashimoto&rsquo;s and you are experiencing weight gain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How can you do that?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The easiest way is to simply take&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-medication/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid medication</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thyroid medication will immediately boost up your thyroid function and, as long as it is dosed correctly, will bring you to normal very quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You don&rsquo;t necessarily have to use medication, though, if you don&rsquo;t want to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are in&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/stages-of-hashimotos/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">early-stage Hashimoto&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;and in a&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/subclinical-hypothyroidism/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">sub-clinical hypothyroid</a>&nbsp;state, you may be able to see improvement by using natural therapies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Treatments like changing your diet, regular exercise, stress reduction, getting enough sleep, and replacing nutrient deficiencies can sometimes be enough to improve your thyroid&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/natural-remedies-for-hashimotos-thyroiditis/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">naturally</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how you get there, just be sure you are focusing on your thyroid function.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#2. Inflammation in Your Body from Immune Dysregulation</h3>



<p>Another cause of weight in Hashimoto&rsquo;s has to do with&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/signs-symptoms-inflammation-hashimotos/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">inflammation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inflammation is not necessarily a bad thing on its own but it can become bad if it becomes rampant or chronic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inflammation is the process by which your body fights off infections and helps your body repair damaged tissues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this sense it&rsquo;s good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it can become a problem when it&rsquo;s not properly managed by the body, when it&rsquo;s found in places it shouldn&rsquo;t be, or when it goes on for long periods of time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this is exactly what happens in patients with Hashimotos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because Hashimoto&rsquo;s is primarily an autoimmune disease, inflammation is a core component of the disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is inflammation that results in thyroid gland damage and the recruitment of&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459262/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">white blood cells</a>&nbsp;(9) into your thyroid gland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, over time, this inflammation of the thyroid gland may cause&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/end-stage-hashimotos/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">irreversible thyroid gland damage</a>&nbsp;making you 100% reliant on thyroid medication for the rest of your life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Systemic inflammation also has a negative impact on other systems in your body including other fat-regulating hormones like insulin and leptin.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/hypothyroidism-insulin-resistance/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Insulin resistance</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/leptin-resistance-thyroid-resistance/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">leptin resistance</a>&nbsp;are both made worse in the face of inflammation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inflammation and your thyroid make weight gain worse in a vicious cycle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Excess weight gain results in the release of&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1483173/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">cytokines and chemokines</a>&nbsp;(10) which in turn may make thyroid function worse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The worse thyroid function gets the easier it is for you to gain weight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the cycle repeats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cooling down inflammation is an important way to stop this cycle to not only prevent further weight gain but to also slow down or stop the attack of your own immune system on your thyroid gland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to managing inflammation in Hashimoto&rsquo;s, one of the best things you can do is simply avoid those things which trigger inflammation or make it worse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Things like eating inflammatory&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/10-foods-hashimotos-patients-should-avoid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">foods and oils</a>, exposing yourself to too much&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/cortisol-and-weight-gain/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">stress</a>, not getting enough&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/how-to-sleep-for-better-thyroid-health-immune-function-weight-loss/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">sleep</a>, exposure to&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2790188/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">environmental chemicals</a>&nbsp;(11) or toxins, and chronic infections, can all contribute to low-grade inflammation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key to stopping this inflammation isn&rsquo;t to take something like an anti-inflammatory medication but instead to stop the root cause of the inflammation.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#3. Sex Hormone Imbalances in Estrogen and Progesterone From Thyroid Dysfunction</h3>



<p>Next up we have sex hormone imbalances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a patient with Hashimoto&rsquo;s, you are probably well familiar with the impact that your thyroid has on your weight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what you may not realize is that there are other hormones that also contribute to your weight and these hormones can be dragged down by your thyroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>



<p>One common&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/hypothyroidism-symptoms-checklist/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">symptom of hypothyroidism</a>&nbsp;(caused by Hashimoto&rsquo;s) is infertility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The inability to conceive is a complex problem but, in the case of thyroid disease, stems from the impact that thyroid dysfunction has on progesterone, estrogen, and ovulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thyroid dysfunction results in&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4724596/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">anovulatory cycles</a>&nbsp;(12) and disordered levels of both estrogen and progesterone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The result? It&rsquo;s much harder for your body to get pregnant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You might be thinking, what does infertility have to do with my weight?</p>



<p>A lot, actually!</p>



<p>Sex hormones such as estrogen and progesterone are hormones that can impact your fat cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During puberty, these levels rise which causes weight gain in certain areas of the female body to accentuate the female figure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In menopause, it is the decline in these hormones that results in&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/menopause-weight-gain/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">weight gain</a>, vasomotor symptoms, bone loss, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, these hormones impact how and where your body stores fat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your thyroid is dysfunctional then you may start to see changes in these sex hormones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The more disordered your&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/low-progesterone-symptoms/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">progesterone</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/low-estrogen-symptoms/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">estrogen</a>&nbsp;become, the more likely you are to gain stubborn fat in specific areas of your body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Excess weight gain in the hips, thighs, and butt region can all stem from sex hormone imbalances.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#4. Changes to your Appetite from Your Mood and Depression</h3>



<p>We all know how important diet is when it comes to managing weight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether you believe that calories are responsible for weight or whether you believe that it&rsquo;s more about the quality of the food you eat that influences your weight, diet is still important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patients with Hashimoto&rsquo;s have a special struggle in this area that other people don&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They have to deal with the ups and downs, mood changes, and&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/hypothyroidism-and-depression/?utm_medium=text&amp;utm_source=attentive&amp;utm_campaign=the-connection-between-hypothyroidism-and-depression"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">depression</a>&nbsp;that stem from thyroid disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly known why Hashimoto&rsquo;s causes these symptoms but one theory is that they are caused by&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30373627/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">neural inflammation</a>&nbsp;(13).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless of their cause, they exist and they can easily lead to weight gain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know that if someone is depressed it&rsquo;s harder to make good decisions about their diet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a lot easier to eat unhealthy foods when you are feeling down because your willpower is sapped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Depression and mood changes don&rsquo;t hit every patient with Hashimoto&rsquo;s but you should be prepared in case it hits you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Be aware of your mood, how it impacts your dietary choices, and how these choices can impact your ability to lose weight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Treating your thyroid and managing inflammation can go a long way to keeping you from experiencing depressive symptoms.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Hashimoto&rsquo;s Weight Loss Frequently Asked Questions:</h2>



<p>Because weight loss is so important to many patients with Hashimoto&rsquo;s, I frequently get a lot of questions on this topic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below I&rsquo;ve included the most frequently asked questions and their answers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have additional questions that aren&rsquo;t answered here please leave your comment below and I will continually add them to this list!</p>



<h3>#1. How Much Weight Can you Gain with Hashimoto&rsquo;s?</h3>



<p>I wish I could say there is some magical number and that it will stop but that&rsquo;s not the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weight gain varies from person to person and it largely depends on the severity of your disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The worse your Hashimoto&rsquo;s and the lower your thyroid function, the more weight you will gain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On average, most women who develop Hashimoto&rsquo;s gain somewhere between 20 and 30 pounds from their thyroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This initial weight gain stems from the thyroid but can then spiral as other problems start to stack on top of each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Initial weight gain can limit your ability to exercise which causes more weight gain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This extra weight may result in hormone imbalances to important hormones such as insulin and leptin which may trigger more weight gain and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This type of vicious cycle is typically what causes weight gain in excess of&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/weight-loss-naturethroid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">50 pounds or more</a>&nbsp;in some Hashimoto&rsquo;s patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For this reason, it is very important that you do whatever it takes to manage your weight before it gets worse!</p>



<p>The more overweight you are and the longer you&rsquo;ve been overweight the more difficult it will be to get back to normal.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#2. How Long Does it Take To Lose Weight if you have Hashimoto&rsquo;s?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>It really depends on the person!</p>



<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s is a dynamic disease which means that it impacts each person a little bit differently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, it&rsquo;s hard to predict how long or how difficult it will be to lose weight for any given person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In general, the worse your Hashimoto&rsquo;s and the more impact it has on thyroid function, the longer it will take you to lose weight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though I can&rsquo;t give you an exact answer, I can give you some general information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assuming you are on the right treatment (which may include thyroid medication) and once you&rsquo;ve dialed in your&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/hashimotos-diet/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">diet</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-stimulating-exercises/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">exercise routine</a>, and so on, you should start to see your weight normalize within about 4-8 weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From there, you will most likely see a steady decline in your weight of about 2-10 pounds per month until you reach your normal body weight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For most thyroid patients this process will take on the order of 6 to 12 months but I&rsquo;ve seen it take as long as 2 years in some cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to your thyroid and your weight, it&rsquo;s a slow process so prepare accordingly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This isn&rsquo;t a bad thing, though, because once you lose weight the right way it will stay off for good!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Embrace the slower consistent weight gain and it will pay you back in dividends for years to come.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#3. How Hard is it to Lose Weight with Hashimoto&rsquo;s?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s a lot more difficult for someone with Hashimoto&rsquo;s to lose weight compared to someone who doesn&rsquo;t have a thyroid problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I always tell thyroid patients that it will take them about twice as long as someone who doesn&rsquo;t have a thyroid problem to lose the same amount of weight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So if someone without a thyroid problem can lose 10 pounds, you should expect to lose 5 pounds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If it takes someone 1 month to lose 10 pounds then you should expect it to take you 2 months instead of one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weight loss is also a little slower if you are a woman as opposed to a man.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s roughly two to three times harder for women to lose the same weight as a man in the same time period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is just a general estimate, though, so don&rsquo;t take it as the gospel truth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are some thyroid patients who are able to manage their weight much easier than other thyroid patients but this is not the norm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to how Hashimoto&rsquo;s impacts your metabolism and due to how difficult it is to get on the right treatment, you should expect weight loss to be fairly difficult.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#4. Will Thyroid Medication Help Me Finally Lose Weight?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Yes, no, and maybe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is definitely the hope that thyroid medication will help patients with Hashimoto&rsquo;s lose weight but that isn&rsquo;t always the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s why:</p>



<p>The most commonly prescribed thyroid medication, levothyroxine, contains one of the least powerful thyroid hormones known as T4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>T4 is not active by itself and must be&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/t4-to-t3-conversion/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">converted into T3</a>&nbsp;in order to act on your cells and do its job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>T3 is the&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/t3-basics/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid hormone</a>&nbsp;responsible for increasing your metabolism, raising your body temperature, and helping you lose weight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So if you are someone who has been given T4 in the form of levothyroxine but your body can&rsquo;t activate it or convert it then weight loss will be very difficult.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What can you do to solve this problem?</p>



<p>You can take a combination&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-medication-names/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid medication</a>&nbsp;that includes both T4 and T3 thyroid hormones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>T3 thyroid hormone can be prescribed by your doctor under the name&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/cytomel-weight-loss/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Cytomel</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/liothyronine/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">liothyronine</a>&nbsp;and that medication can be taken along with your prescription of&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/take-levothyroxine/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">levothyroxine</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This allows you to take both T4 and T3 thyroid hormones at the same time and gives your body more of the thyroid hormone that actually helps you lose weight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It gets even more complicated when you realize that the amount of T4 and T3 that you take needs to be individualized for the person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, someone with Hashimoto&rsquo;s may be fine using 100mcg of T4 and 10mcg of T3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, another patient with Hashimoto&rsquo;s may need 80mcg of T4 and 20mcg of T3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This balancing of T4 and T3 should be done on an individual basis to figure out what that person does best on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to arrive at your optimal dose, you will need&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/normal-thyroid-levels/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid lab tests</a>&nbsp;beyond just the TSH.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You will need to look at your free thyroid hormone levels including free T3, free T4, and reverse T3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you are on the right medication for your body you can then expect your thyroid medication to help you lose weight.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#5. Does Hashimoto&rsquo;s Cause Belly Fat?</h3>



<p>Yes! Hashimoto&rsquo;s can absolutely cause belly fat but it can also cause you to gain weight elsewhere on your body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may or may not be aware but the location&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/body-fat-hormone-guide/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">where you gain weight on your body</a>&nbsp;can tell you a lot about your hormones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Belly fat, for instance, is usually caused by an increase in cortisol or insulin.</p>



<p>Low thyroid disease (such as that seen in Hashimoto&rsquo;s) typically causes weight gain over the entire body in an equal fashion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So if you&rsquo;ve gained weight just about everywhere including your arms, thighs, back, belly, and butt, then it&rsquo;s most likely from your thyroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But because thyroid hormone has an influence on both cortisol and insulin, it&rsquo;s possible that Hashimoto&rsquo;s may also result in belly fat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key to losing belly fat if you have Hashimoto&rsquo;s is all about treating your thyroid first and then picking up any leftover hormone imbalances afterward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you optimize your thyroid you should see your metabolism improve which will naturally reduce your weight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you still notice you have belly fat after optimizing your thyroid then you can look into other hormone imbalances such as insulin resistance or excess&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/cortisol-and-weight-gain/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">cortisol levels</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#6. How do I know my Thyroid is Causing my Weight Gain?</h3>



<p>It&rsquo;s actually more difficult than you might think!</p>



<p>It is well known in the scientific literature that low thyroid function results in weight gain but, for whatever reason, doctors will look to blame just about anything else except your thyroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To some degree, they are on the right track but their approach is still misguided.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They are partially on the right track because the truth is that there are many conditions that can contribute to weight gain aside from your thyroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before you blame your thyroid, you will want to make sure that these other factors are not contributing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, you can&rsquo;t blame your thyroid for weight gain if you are sleeping 4 hours per night.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can&rsquo;t blame your thyroid for your weight if you are eating an unhealthy diet, going through menopause, avoiding exercise, stressed out of your mind, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these factors can and will have an impact on your weight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the easiest ways to check if your thyroid is contributing to your weight gain is by excluding these other factors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you notice that you&rsquo;ve suddenly gained 10-20 pounds out of the blue, without changing your diet or exercise pattern, AND you are experiencing the symptoms of low thyroid, then there&rsquo;s a very high chance your weight gain is from your thyroid and not something else.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#7. Is Intermittent Fasting Good for Hashimoto&rsquo;s?</h3>



<p>It can be!&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s a big controversy going on about intermittent fasting and how it may help with weight loss.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On one hand, some people believe that it only helps because you are being forced into a state of caloric restriction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other, some people believe that there is something uniquely beneficial to hormones like insulin when you avoid eating for a set period of time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I happen to believe that fasting has benefits outside of its impact on calorie consumption which is why I believe it can be a&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/fasting-for-weight-loss/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">very useful tool for thyroid patients</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But even if it doesn&rsquo;t and it turns out that it&rsquo;s only beneficial because it reduces your calorie intake, it still helps!</p>



<p>As long as you don&rsquo;t over fast (push your body into a state where it triggers an adaptive starvation mode) then fasting is a safe and effective therapy for most thyroid patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As always, be sure to keep your individual circumstance in mind when considering whether to fast or not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it is beneficial for many people it can cause problems for others.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>



<p>Hopefully, you now have a better understanding of what leads to weight gain in Hashimoto&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not quite as straightforward as &ldquo;you ate too many calories&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The truth is that most patients with thyroid disease gain weight without changing their diet or exercise routine because of the impact that the thyroid has on metabolism and other hormone systems in the body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it is these hormone systems that must be regulated and balanced if you want long-lasting weight loss.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now I want to hear from you:</p>



<p><strong>Do you have Hashimoto&rsquo;s and are you gaining weight?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Do you know the cause of your weight gain?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Are you having any luck in improving your thyroid and metabolism?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Do you feel that you have other hormone imbalances contributing to your weight?</strong></p>

<h2>Vitamin D Deficiency is Very Common in Hashimoto&rsquo;s Patients (And a Big Problem)</h2>



<p>What do sunlight, winter, and how you are feeling have in common?</p>



<p>They all have an impact on your vitamin D level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vitamin D is a crucial nutrient that acts more like a hormone than a vitamin and it helps to regulate a number of different systems in your body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vitamin D has an impact on your immune system,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/vitamin-d-thyroid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">your thyroid</a>, your risk of cancer, your mood, your bone density, and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you can imagine, optimizing this important vitamin hormone is ideal if you want to have adequate thyroid function.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for anyone reading this, cases of vitamin D deficiency are on the rise and at record numbers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s currently estimated that as much as one-third of the entire population&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11888-1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">of the world</a>&nbsp;(1) may not have sufficient vitamin D levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes specifically to Hashimoto&rsquo;s patients, some studies show that as many as&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29528579/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">76% of patients</a>&nbsp;(2) are deficient in vitamin D!&nbsp;</p>



<p>These types of numbers are just mind-boggling, especially when you consider the impact that this one deficiency has on our healthcare system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if you are reading this then you probably already know at least a little bit about why vitamin D is so important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After all, it&rsquo;s frequently recommended as a superstar vitamin for those with Hashimoto&rsquo;s thyroiditis (and thyroid disease of any type).&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s why this article exists, to discuss whether or not you should use vitamin D if you have Hashimoto&rsquo;s, how much you should take, the best way to get it, and much more.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Benefits of Vitamin D On Thyroid Function in Patients with Hashimoto&rsquo;s</h2>



<p>Before we talk about how much vitamin D you should or shouldn&rsquo;t take we should take a minute to talk about the potential benefits of using vitamin D as it relates to your thyroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luckily for us, vitamin D is one of the most well-studied vitamins/hormones out there so there are plenty of studies to look at.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These studies show the impact that vitamin D may have on your thyroid function.</p>



<p>This information is helpful because it can let you know what to expect if you plan on taking vitamin D.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The potential benefits of taking vitamin D if you have Hashimoto&rsquo;s include:&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#1. Protects Against Thyroid Autoimmunity</h3>



<p>It is well known that vitamin D helps to regulate your immune system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Low vitamin D levels have been shown to increase your individual risk of developing several different types of&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6047889/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">autoimmune diseases</a>&nbsp;(3) including&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/hashimotos-thyroiditis/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Hashimoto&rsquo;s thyroiditis</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also know that there is some correlation between your risk of getting sick and your vitamin D level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lower your vitamin D level the more likely you are to get sick and the more likely you are to develop a range of autoimmune conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just because your vitamin D level is low doesn&rsquo;t guarantee that these things will occur but it does slightly increase your risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For most of you reading this, the damage has probably already been done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s less about prevention and more about management now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The good news is that optimizing your vitamin D level is still a good idea even if you&rsquo;ve already been diagnosed with Hashimoto&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember:</p>



<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s is primarily a disease of your immune system which results in&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/signs-symptoms-inflammation-hashimotos/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid gland inflammation</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/end-stage-hashimotos/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid gland damage</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Optimizing vitamin D levels may, therefore, provide you with a way to calm down this inflammation and prevent or at least slowdown thyroid gland damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The extent of this benefit is not clear and doesn&rsquo;t appear to work for everyone with Hashimoto&rsquo;s but it&rsquo;s always a good idea to&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28073128/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">restore deficiencies</a>&nbsp;(4) if present.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So even if taking vitamin D doesn&rsquo;t result in a drop in your thyroid antibodies it&rsquo;s still worth it for the benefit it has on your overall health.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#2. TSH is Negatively Correlated with Vitamin D Levels</h3>



<p>Next, we know that vitamin D and TSH levels seem to have a negative correlation with one another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What does this mean?&nbsp;</p>



<p>It means that as vitamin D decreases your TSH may increase and, on the flip side, it also means that as vitamin D increases your TSH may decrease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s make some sense of that statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>TSH stands for&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/tsh-levels-normal/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thyroid-stimulating hormone</a>&nbsp;and it&rsquo;s the hormone that doctors frequently use to check how well your thyroid is working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/low-tsh/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">low TSH</a>&nbsp;is usually indicative of hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid) and a&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/high-tsh/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">high TSH</a>&nbsp;is usually indicative of hypothyroidism (too little thyroid).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In patients with Hashimoto&rsquo;s thyroiditis, a high TSH is usually an early sign that your body is attacking and causing problems for your thyroid gland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So when a patient takes vitamin D and sees a decline in TSH (to normal healthy levels) this is a good thing!</p>



<p>It means that the thyroid is functioning better on its own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Changes in TSH levels are always relative to where they started but you can generally think about anything that lowers TSH naturally to be a good thing for Hashimoto&rsquo;s patients (it means the thyroid is working better on its own).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is there a catch here?</p>



<p>A little bit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It seems that vitamin D only has an impact on those who&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32239452/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">already have vitamin D deficiency</a>&nbsp;(5).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, taking vitamin D if your vitamin D level is already normal most likely will not boost your thyroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But with deficiency rates as high as 76%, the odds are definitely on your side.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, this benefit occurs with higher than average doses which do slightly increase your risk of hypervitaminosis D.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As long as you understand optimal ranges (which we will talk about later) this isn&rsquo;t a big issue, though.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>#3. Free T3 and Free T4 are Positively Correlated with Vitamin D Levels</h3>



<p>Much like TSH, researchers have found that there is a positive correlation between&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/free-t3/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">free T3</a>,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/free-t4-normal-range/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">free T4</a>, and vitamin D.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This situation is a bit easier to understand than the TSH situation because free thyroid hormones are important for regulating thyroid function.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In general, you want your free T3 and free T4 levels to be optimized if you want your thyroid to function correctly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The higher your free T3 and free T4 the better (as long as they don&rsquo;t go outside of the reference range).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the link between vitamin D and free thyroid hormone levels is not as straightforward as you might think.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we know is this:</p>



<p>Lower free thyroid hormone levels (of both fT3 and fT4) increase your risk of developing vitamin D deficiency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What we don&rsquo;t know is which comes first or which one causes the other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It may be the case that as Hashimoto&rsquo;s progresses, and your free thyroid hormone levels drop, it is this drop then causes a decrease in vitamin D.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It could also be the case that vitamin D deficiency comes first and causes a direct drop in free thyroid hormone levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless of which comes first, it&rsquo;s still a good idea to optimize your vitamin D status so that both your vitamin D and thyroid can work together in tandem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just don&rsquo;t necessarily expect a huge bump in your free thyroid hormone levels when you use vitamin D supplements.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>How Much Vitamin D Should You Take?</h2>



<p>Hopefully, these benefits were enough to get you excited about using vitamin D which brings us to our next question:</p>



<p>How much vitamin D should you take if you have Hashimoto&rsquo;s and want to supplement?</p>



<p>I wish I could give you a straightforward answer but because vitamin D levels vary from person to person that is a lot harder than it sounds.</p>



<p>Instead, what I can do is give you some general guidelines to follow which will help you determine the best dose for your body which will help you avoid taking too much and experiencing any unwanted side effects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike some other vitamins and nutrients out there, it is possible to take too much vitamin D.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vitamin D is considered a fat-soluble vitamin so it&rsquo;s not as readily excreted by your body as water-soluble vitamins like B vitamins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having said that, it&rsquo;s easy to avoid over-supplementation as long as you are keeping an eye on your vitamin D levels (more on that below).&nbsp;</p>



<p>When using vitamin D for Hashimoto&rsquo;s, here are a few guidelines to follow:</p>



<ul><li><em>Before using vitamin D supplements, test your vitamin D level with the 25-hydroxy vitamin D test to see your starting point.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Vitamin D dosing for Hashimoto&rsquo;s patients ranges from 1,000 IU per day to 10,000 IU per day.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>A safe daily dose is usually around 2,000 IU to 3,000 IU per day.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Taking your vitamin D with a fatty meal can help increase absorption.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>If you are taking vitamin D daily and not seeing an increase in your level then try taking it with magnesium (</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/magnesium-and-hashimotos/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>magnesium</em></a><em>&nbsp;can help boost vitamin D levels).&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Liquid vitamin D (vitamin D drops) may be better absorbed compared to capsules/tablets.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Use a&nbsp;</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/product/pure-d3-liquid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>vitamin D3 supplement</em></a><em>&nbsp;(not a vitamin D2 supplement).&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Once you&rsquo;ve been using vitamin D for 2-3 months, get retested to see how much you&rsquo;ve increased.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Try to optimize your 25-hydroxy vitamin d level somewhere between 40-60 ng/mL (the reference range is 30-100 ng/mL).&nbsp;</em></li></ul>



<p>If this information is more confusing than helpful then most people are pretty safe to start with a dose of around&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.restartmed.com/product/thyroid-daily-essentials-thyroid-multivitamin/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">2,000 IU per day</a>!</p>



<h2>The Best Form of Vitamin D for Hashimoto&rsquo;s</h2>



<p>There are two main forms that vitamin D supplements come in and one is definitely better than the other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two forms include:</p>



<ul><li><em>Vitamin D2</em></li><li><em>and Vitamin D3</em></li></ul>



<p>When it comes to supplementing, vitamin D3 is the superior form.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vitamin D2 tends to come from plant sources, is cheaper to produce, and may be of lesser quality compared to D3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, studies show that vitamin D3 is more potent at raising 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels compared to the D2 version.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has to do with how your liver metabolizes D2 and D3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The metabolism of D3 in the body results in more 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 than D2 even at equivalent doses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to quality, D3 wins again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vitamin D2 is more susceptible to temperature changes and humidity which means that vitamin D2 supplements likely don&rsquo;t last as long as D3 supplements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are taking a vitamin D supplement then check to make sure you are using the D3 formulation and not the D2 formulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll know if you are using the right formulation because the supplement fact panel on the back of your supplement will say cholecalciferol (which is D3).&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your supplement fact panel says ergocalciferol then you are using the D2 formulation.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The Best Way To Test For Vitamin D Deficiency</h2>



<p>There are several ways to assess your vitamin D status and each test has a different purpose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to testing for vitamin D deficiency the best test is&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3243871/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">25-hydroxyvitamin D</a>&nbsp;(6).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other vitamin D tests can be used to assess how well you are responding to treatment but should not be used to diagnose a deficiency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These tests include:</p>



<ul><li><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/test-catalog/Overview/8822"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D</a>&nbsp;(7) &ndash; This is the active metabolite form of vitamin D but your body only converts a small percentage of your total vitamin D to this metabolite as necessary. As a result, 25-hydroxy vitamin D is still a better marker of overall vitamin D status.&nbsp;</li><li><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/test-catalog/Overview/83670"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">25-hydroxy vitamin D2</a>&nbsp;(8) &ndash; This represents the amount of vitamin D2 your body has absorbed from plant sources.&nbsp;</li><li>25-hydroxy vitamin D3 &ndash; This is the amount of vitamin D3 your body has absorbed from animal sources or from supplements.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The 25-hydroxy vitamin D2 and D3 metabolites may be helpful in cases where you are taking supplements and not seeing an increase in your 25-hydroxy vitamin D status.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They are typically not recommended for monitoring, though, and are really only used in specific cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The test you want to get before you supplement is 25-hydroxy vitamin D.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Vitamin D Supplements vs The Sun</h2>



<p>Even though you can get an active vitamin D metabolite (D3) from supplements, there may be a better source:</p>



<p>The sun.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When UVB rays from the sun hit your skin they activate cholesterol which transforms it into vitamin D.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This process is so effective that in as little as 30 minutes your body can create the equivalent of&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19667143/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">10,000 to 20,000 IUs</a>&nbsp;(9) of vitamin D in supplement form!&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, you also get the added benefits of&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290997/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">healthier skin</a>&nbsp;(10) (via the prevention of several skin conditions), better regulation of&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2728098/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">your mood</a>&nbsp;(11), and regulation of your&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6751071/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">circadian rhythm</a>&nbsp;(12).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Getting vitamin D from the sun is not as easy as it sounds, though, because there are many factors that can reduce how effective sun exposure can be for vitamin D synthesis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you want to get vitamin D the all-natural way then you need to follow these instructions:</p>



<ul><li><em>Spend 10-20 minutes in the sun each day when the sun is directly over your head. If you go outside and the sun casts a shadow taller or longer than your body then the angle of the sun is not ideal.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Expose at least 40% of your body to sunlight. This ensures enough surface area that the UVB rays can activate vitamin D in your skin.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Avoid using sunscreen! Sunscreen will block UVB rays which means they won&rsquo;t help you create more vitamin D.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Avoid going out in the sun if it is overcast. Clouds block UVB rays which means you won&rsquo;t create vitamin D.&nbsp;</em></li></ul>



<p>The&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28662556/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">latitude at which you live</a>&nbsp;(13) also impacts how effective sun exposure is at creating vitamin D.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The closer you are to the equator the more likely sun exposure is to benefit you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The farther north or south you are from the equator the less effective sun exposure is at creating vitamin D.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At some extreme latitudes (north or south), you may have no option but to use vitamin D supplements.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Not only does vitamin D play an important role in your overall health but it also helps to regulate and control several aspects of thyroid function.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These aspects are all crucial to maintaining a healthy thyroid gland that is free from inflammation, disruption of thyroid hormones, and disruption of pituitary hormones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because so many patients with Hashimoto&rsquo;s thyroiditis suffer from vitamin D deficiency and because of its impact on both the thyroid and immune system, using vitamin D supplements may be an easy way to reverse a deficiency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before using vitamin D supplements make sure you check your vitamin D level with a 25-hydroxy vitamin d lab test.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you have your results you can determine if you need to use a vitamin D3 supplement (which is the best form).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keeping an eye on your vitamin D lab tests is a great idea if you start supplementing to make sure you don&rsquo;t take too much.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now I want to hear from you:</p>



<p><strong>Did you know that taking vitamin D may help reduce your thyroid antibodies or increase your free thyroid hormones?</strong></p>



<p><strong>When was the last time you had your vitamin D level checked?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Were you in the optimal range?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Are you planning on getting tested after reading this?</strong></p>

http://whole-dog-journal.com/rss,5 Things I Would Never Do With My Dogs,"<p>There is a trend on TikTok right now where various experts are sharing “things they would never do” after some years of experience in a certain field. The “things” are all activities that would expose a person to needless risks. I’m a dog writer, not a TikTok creator, but here’s my contribution to the genre! Based on my personal experience (and access to the experience of our many contributors and readers, shared with me over the past 25 years of editing WDJ), here are the top five things I would <em>never</em> do with my dogs to compromise their safety and wellbeing – from choices in dog chews to behavior training classes.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Leave my dogs home alone when there is a potentially disastrous condition nearby.</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It took only one conversation with an owner whose dogs were home alone and killed in a fire to teach me this important lesson; the pain in her eyes haunts me to this day.</p>
<p>When wildfires erupt, authorities are quick to call for mandatory evacuations and they close roads to keep people from going home to rescue their livestock or pets. While this seems barbaric to the owner frantic to get home to save their pets, the public safety officers’ mandate is to save human lives above all else. They will allow registered animal emergency evacuation teams into closed areas if they deem the situation safe enough, but this is rarely the case in the first day of any kind of disaster.</p>
<p>Obviously, if you’re already at work when a fire breaks out in your area – or a levee breaks and floodwaters are engulfing your neighborhood – there is not much you can do. Find out who you can contact to report the need for your animals to be rescued; there is almost always an agency that is assigned to this important task.</p>
<p>But if there is a fire burning within 30 miles of your home, a tornado warning in your area, or it’s hurricane season and your local river is rising, <em>take your pets with you if you leave the house. </em>I’ve taken my dogs to a friend’s house when I had to go <em>to the store</em> with a fire burning 10 miles away. Leaving them home is not a chance I will take.</p>
<p>If you’re leaving your dog with a pet sitter, supply them with a “go bag” in case of an emergency. We cover more about this in our blog post, <a href=""/blog/leaving-town-make-sure-a-go-bag-is-available-to-your-pets-caretaker-before-you-leave/"">“Leaving town? Make sure a “go bag” is available to your pets’ caretaker before you leave!”</a></p>

<h3>Sign up for a dog training class without researching the dog trainer and observing classes first.</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Monitoring training-advice Facebook groups, I’ve read many posts from people who have paid for a six-week class, only to wonder if they should quit after the first session because the instructor insists that all the participants use choke chains and/or use leash yanks. Every time I hear this, I want to ask, “How was this a surprise? Why did you not observe a class first?”</p>

Consider it a safety drill! Conditions can change rapidly and public safety officers might not allow you to return if the situation goes south.</figcaption></figure>
<p>I read dog trainers’ websites carefully, looking for evidence of a positive-training education and credentials. If their website gives little detail beyond years of experience and some catch-phrases (including “positive dog training”), I send an email and ask what programs they have graduated from and which training conferences or seminars they most recently attended. I want to see passion for and commitment to continuing education, because modern training is advancing every year.</p>
<p>I recommend observing any dog  trainer you’re considering taking a class with. I’d watch the instructor teach several classes of beginning-level students, because watching an advanced class march around flawlessly will not tell you whether force and fear were used to get the dogs to that level. I’d be looking for smiles on the faces of the dog handlers and loose, relaxed body language from the dogs and puppies. If the humans look grim and the dogs look shut down, I wouldn’t sign up for even a single session, much less a six-week class. And if the dogs show up in class wearing choke chains, pinch collars, or shock collars, I know it’s not the style of training I want to pursue with my dog.</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>
<h3>Let dogs play with other dogs while wearing collars or harnesses.</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I had read warnings from people who claimed that it was unsafe to allow dogs to wear collars while playing, but until I saw for myself what could happen, I thought the warnings were overblown and unnecessarily dramatic.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>When wrestling or playing “bitey face” games, it’s <em>very</em> easy for a dog to get his or her jaw stuck in the gear worn by their playmate. Don’t think because you haven’t seen it, it won’t happen to your dog; all it takes is a single playmate who likes to grab other dogs by the collar. And when this happens, both dogs panic and <em>freak out.</em> It’s incredibly difficult in the resulting melee to figure out how to free both dogs, especially as they spin, roll, and scream in pain and panic.</p>
<p>Since we first ran an article about this potential hazard (“<a href=""/care/collars-harnesses-leashes-muzzles/dont-wait-prevent-collar-accidents/"">Don’t Wait: Prevent Collar Accidents</a>,” December 2020), dozens of readers have shared stories about dogs who have been maimed, traumatized, and even killed by their own collars. I guarantee you that my warning is not overblown. Become familiar with dog collar safety and let your dogs “play naked.”</p>
<ol start=""4"">
<li>
<h3>Give my dogs most rawhide chews.</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I would not give my dogs any of the following dog chews: dried pigs ears, dried bones (the kind sold in pet supply stores), or most rawhide or so-called “collagen” products (same thing) sold in pet supply stores.</p>
<p>I am <em>very</em> selective when it comes to dog chew items. Dead animal parts of unknown age and unknown country-of-origin, processed with dog-knows-what chemicals? No thank you.</p>
<p>There are two issues here: the potential for the items to be contaminated, with either <em>Salmonella</em> and other food-borne pathogens <em>or</em> potentially toxic chemicals used in the item’s processing; and the physical danger to dogs from lacerations to the throat or intestines or impactions in the dog’s stomach or intestines.</p>
<p>Nothing that holds up to assertive chewing for long should be consumed in quantity. And if it doesn’t hold up to assertive chewing, it will be consumed in quantity!</p>
<p>I do supply my foster puppies and adolescent dogs with <em>certain</em> chew items (more about that in a second) for limited periods of time when I want them to entertain themselves quietly for a bit. I also will give my adult dogs a certain chew item once in a while as a treat. But daily chewing is just not necessary – and it’s a risk! Yes, it’s an enjoyable natural behavior for dogs – <em>and</em> the activity is fraught with dangers. There isn’t <em>anything</em> under the sun that dogs chew on that’s safe for <em>all</em> dogs; veterinarians have surgically removed hunks of anything you can name from the perforated or impacted bowels of countless dogs.</p>
<p>What chew items do I feel good about, under strict supervision and for limited periods of time? Absolutely nothing that dogs can consume completely or to a swallowable size in under an hour.</p>
<p>I <em>will</em> procure fresh, gigantic, raw, meaty bones for my dogs once in a while – and I take them away the moment they are small enough for my dogs to get between their molars.</p>
<p>For the teething puppy or adolescent who needs to learn to be content in short-term confinement, I’ll buy dried “bully sticks” (a.k.a. “pizzles” or dried cattle penises) – but only the ones that are about three feet long, and I throw them away when they get to about six or seven inches (swallowable size).</p>
<p>For a number of years there was a <em>single</em> company that manufactured rawhide chew products that I felt were safe: sourced fresh from a slaughter plant in the United States (rather than a tannery in some third-world country) and made into giant rolls of extraordinary thickness. The rolls were so thick that it took even my very aggressive chewer an hour to chew an inch or so of these rolls (and then I’d take it away, to save for another day). That company fell victim to COVID-era shutdowns, alas. My search goes on for a company that makes a similar dog chew, but I haven’t found it yet.</p>

<h3>Agree to having my dog vaccinated for anything that I haven’t researched and planned for in advance.</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can’t properly research whether your dog needs a particular vaccination while at the veterinarian’s office. And while it would be lovely to be able to trust any veterinarian’s opinion that your dog would benefit from whatever vaccination they feel is missing from your dog’s chart, the fact is, sometimes veterinary professionals are just checking the boxes, especially at well-pet visits.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong; I’m not an anti-vaxxer. I’m a strong proponent of making certain my dogs have the vaccines that will protect them from hazards they are likely to encounter. But neither do I want to overvaccinate. Nor do I want to vaccinate my extremely senior dog for <em>anything;</em> I don’t believe in messing with dogs’ immune systems late in life!</p>
<p>Periodically, I pay for vaccine titer tests to determine whether my dogs possess levels of antibodies for distemper and parvovirus that will provide protection against those diseases. I won’t permit them to be vaccinated for those diseases again until they are needed.</p>
<p>Also, I pay attention to what they might be considered “due” for! I just don’t want to be blind-sided or strong-armed over something with potentially long-term consequences for my dog’s health.</p>
<p>If a vet has information about something new or terrific that may benefit my dog, I say, “Great! Let me read up on that. If it seems like the safety profile is good and it’s likely to offer protection from something my dog is likely to encounter, I’ll make another appointment to come back and get that.” And I will!</p>

<p>I would never deliberately scare my dog by disguising or altering my appearance. My dog Clara was a feral puppy, and I was the only person in the world she trusted for a very long time. Once, I unthinkingly wore something that was unusual enough that she didn’t recognize me – and she was <em>petrified. </em>I was her anchor in the human world, and I was gone, with a stranger in my place. But I wouldn’t do it to a gregarious dog either. We can’t know ahead of time how much a switch like that might scare any individual dog, and fear isn’t funny. – <strong>Eileen Anderson</strong></p>

<p>I would never attach my dog to a retractable leash. That was true for Samantha and Chloe, my calm Labradors of yesteryear, and it’s especially true about my current Lab Blue Sapphire, who is twice as athletic and loves to chase anything that moves. I might as well have a raccoon or maybe a coyote on the leash! <strong>– CJ Puotinen</strong></p>
<p><em>CJ is a long-time WDJ contributor and author of </em>The Encyclopedia of Natural Pet Care <em>and many other books. </em></p>
<p>I would <em>never</em> turn my dog loose in a dog park without first observing the behavior, actions, and interactions of the dogs and the humans inside the park. Obviously, dogs who don’t play well with others should not be taken to dog parks. The problem is, sometimes these dogs belong to humans who don’t understand this or just don’t care. Resource-guarding can turn ugly in a hurry if another dog doesn’t understand or respect it.  Dogs with over-the-top prey drive are not fun for other dogs. And some dogs are just plain too rough. I saw a beautiful young Lab whose hind leg had been grabbed by another dog chasing him. The result? A severed Achilles’ tendon.</p>
<p>Observe the humans, too. People do dumb things! I saw a human thoughtlessly throw a ball such that two competing dogs went for it from opposite directions and collided face first. The result was broken teeth, lots of blood, and expensive veterinary bills. I saw a human throwing a flying disc for their own dog dangerously close to large rocks. Someone else’s dog went for the disc and crashed into a giant rock. That dog left the park on three legs.</p>
<p>If you see anything that looks remotely dangerous, don’t go in. And be alert if a new dog and human enter the park. Any newcomer can change the dynamic of the pack. Collect your dog and observe the new dynamic before deciding whether to stay. <strong>– Eileen Fatcheric, DVM</strong></p>
<p><em>Dr. Fatcheric writes articles about veterinary medicine for WDJ and is a passionate and successful competitor with her dogs in agility. </em></p>
<p>I’d never make my dog uncomfortable for a laugh. This isn’t a new impulse for humans – I remember watching college guys give beer to their dog and laugh at the stumbling result – but social media has put this impulse on steroids. I cringe whenever I see a dog-themed TikTok start to trend, because all sorts of folks will jump onto the bandwagon, like “Scare your dog to see what they do.”</p>
<p>It only takes a quick scroll for anybody with any knowledge of dog body language to feel devastated by these “funny” videos. The dogs are totally freaked out. The human world they’ve landed in is confusing enough for dogs. It’s heartbreaking to watch the person the dog trusts most deliberately set them up to feel an intense, uncomfortable emotion like fear.  <strong>– Kathy Callahan</strong></p>
<p><em>Kathy is a dog trainer and author of </em>101 Rescue Puppies: One Family’s Story of Fostering Dogs, Love, and Trust.</p>
<p>Most of the things I would never do with my dog involve the use of force, pain, or fear. For example, I would <em>never</em> use a shock collar. There is no reason to shock your dog – not even the euphemistic low-level “stim” that shock-collar trainers try to convince you is not aversive. Studies confirm the position that force-free trainers have long held: Coercive methods are likely to lead to significant behavioral issues, especially aggression.</p>
<p>Also, I would never try to grab something from my dog’s mouth. As I tell my clients all the time – even if it’s rat poison, or your grandmother’s diamond bracelet – you’re likely to get the “something” back faster and with much less harm if you calmly ask the dog to trade rather than trying to grab the item. Offer a high-value treat in exchange! This is especially true if you have taught your dog to trade on cue in advance. – <strong>Pat Miller</strong></p>

http://whole-dog-journal.com/rss,How to Find Relief for Arthritis in Dogs,"<p>Just like the humans they live with, dogs often develop arthritis as they age. The most common form is osteoarthritis, also called degenerative joint disease, in which cushioning cartilage within the joints becomes brittle and breaks down, resulting in painful inflammation that interferes with every canine activity.</p>
<h3>How Long Can a Dog Live With Arthritis?</h3>
<p>Arthritis isn’t fatal, so your dog won’t die of it. In fact, dogs with arthritis can live well into their teens, but they may lead restricted and pain-filled lives. Our challenge as caregivers is to help our best friends stay active for as long as possible. Become familiar with the risk factors and symptoms of arthritis so that you can anticipate, recognize, document, and treat the signs of arthritis before they incapacitate your dog.</p>
<p>Risk factors for osteoarthritis include the dog’s size (larger breeds and overweight dogs are more likely to develop joint pain), age (the risk increases over time), genetics (some breeds are associated with joint abnormalities such as hip dysplasia that lead to arthritis in Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, and German Shepherd Dogs), stress and trauma injuries, an inflammatory diet, diabetes, and diseases transmitted by tick bites.</p>
<p>Symptoms of arthritis in dogs vary from one patient to the next but as the illness progresses, most dogs experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>intermittent lameness</li>
<li>“hopping” or three-legged gait</li>
<li>stiffness after rest or after vigorous exercise</li>
<li>abnormal stance when walking</li>
<li>reluctance to rise or move</li>
<li>depression or lack of interest</li>
<li>joints that hurt when touched or swollen joints that are tender and warm to the touch</li>
</ul>

<p>A thorough veterinary examination is needed to rule out physical injuries or non-arthritic conditions that can cause pain, make a diagnosis, and suggest treatment options. Those are likely to include prescription pain-relieving, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as carprofen, firocoxib, meloxicam, grapiprant, or etodolac. These are the most effective treatments for arthritis, hands-down.</p>
<p>For severe, chronic arthritis, more and more vets are prescribing amantadine, an N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that works in combination with other drugs to treat chronic pain (see “<a href=""/health/amantadine-for-dogs-new-for-relief-of-chronic-pain/"">Amantadine: Now for Relief of Chronic Pain</a>,” WDJ August 2022).</p>
<p>In addition, your veterinarian may recommend the following for dog arthritis relief:</p>
<ul>
<li>nutritional supplements</li>
<li>hydrotherapy (swimming or the use of an underwater treadmill)</li>
<li>chiropractic adjustments</li>
<li>acupuncture</li>
<li>regular low-impact exercise</li>
<li>laser treatments</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Help a Dog With Arthritis at Home</h3>
<p>There are quite a few things you can do at home to help your dog with their arthritis symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Help your dog lose weight.</strong> This sounds simple, but it is one of the most powerful things you can do to help her stay active because being overweight stresses the joints. Foods with high protein and moderate fat levels are better for overweight dogs than typical high-carbohydrate, low-protein weight-loss diets.</p>
<p><strong>Keep your dog hydrated.</strong> Dehydration complicates joint problems, so it’s important to provide fresh water in clean bowls at all times. To encourage your dog to drink more water, add small amounts of bone broth or other flavorings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide resting areas with extra padding.</strong> Dogs sleep more than people, an estimated 12 to 18 hours a day, and their beds make a difference. Some orthopedic mattresses consist of a memory foam base and a layer of gel memory foam, while others use an egg-crate-shaped orthopedic foam, support foam, or layers of shredded memory foam. Egg-crate memory foam helps keep sleeping dogs from overheating by increasing air circulation.</p>
<p>To be sure your dog’s orthopedic mattress will be a good fit, check the manufacturer’s measurement guidelines and buy the right size. In general, sturdy lightweight materials are easy to clean. For dogs with reduced mobility and possible in-house accidents, beds with waterproof liners and removable, machine washable covers simplify cleanup.</p>
<p><strong>Provide traction.</strong> Slick floors, whether polished wood or shiny vinyl, pose health risks to dogs with arthritis. Use carpet or sisal grass runners in hallways or wherever your dog needs traction. Surround his food and water bowls with a rubber-backed rug so he can lower his head to eat or drink without his hind legs slipping out from under him.</p>
<p><strong>Raise the bowl.</strong> If your dog has started hesitating at the food bowl or loses his balance as he eats, try a raised feeder. We’re not fans of raised bowls for all dogs, as they have been shown to increase the incidence of bloat, but a raised platform for feeding can help a very arthritic dog reach his food more comfortably.</p>
<p><strong>Keep him moving! </strong>Make light but regular exercise part of your dog’s everyday routine. The less an arthritic dog moves, the more muscle mass is lost, and the less stable the joints become. Exercise rebuilds and maintains muscle strength, helps with weight reduction, and improves circulation to affected joints. The goal is to provide the benefits of exercise without overdoing it, as too much exercise can damage the joints, causing pain or injury. The key words here are “slow and steady.” Ask your veterinarian about physical activities that are appropriate for your dog.</p>
<p><strong>Use a harness.</strong> Attaching a leash to your dog’s collar can stress the neck muscles and vertebrae. Instead, use a harness and reduce the risk of neck injury by attaching the leash to your dog’s chest or back.</p>
<p><strong>Massage that dog!</strong> Arthritis is associated with a lack of lymph circulation, and an effective way to help improve your dog’s condition is with massage. See “10 ways to improve your dog’s lymph circulation,” WDJ January 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Help him up.</strong> For dogs with advanced arthritis, climbing stairs or standing up after lying down can be painful. Dog-lift slings or harnesses remove pressure from painful joints by allowing handlers to physically lift the dog’s hindquarters. Ramps and steps help dogs jump into cars or onto the bed or sofa.</p>
<p><strong>Keep him warm.</strong> Because cold temperatures can worsen arthritis pain, a sweater, jacket, or heated dog bed can help aching joints feel better in cold weather.</p>
<h3>Helpful Supplements to Help a Dog With Arthritis</h3>
<p>There are a number of supplements that you can give your dog in addition to the prescription pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory drugs that your veterinarian prescribes.</p>
<p>The most widely recommended supplements for dogs with arthritis are <strong>glycosaminoglycans</strong> (GAGs). Also known as mucopolysaccharides, these nutraceutical supplements include glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine HCl, and chondroitin sulfate. Sometimes the unprocessed sources of GAG supplements, such as beef cartilage and green-lipped mussels, are used.</p>
<p>“GAGs are important because they actually protect the joint rather than just reduce symptoms by helping rebuild car-tilage and restore synovial (joint) fluid,” explains canine health researcher Mary Straus at <a href=""http://dogaware.com/"">dogaware.com</a>. “GAGs may also have some preventive effect on arthritis, though this is speculative.”</p>
<p>GAG supplements may be most effective given between meals, though they can be fed with food if needed. “Always start with high doses,” says Straus, “so you will be able to tell whether your dog responds. If you see improvement, reduce the dosage to see if the improvement can be maintained at a lower dose. If you don’t see any improvement within three to four weeks, try another supplement.”</p>
<p><strong>S-adenosylmethione</strong> (SAMe, pronounced “SAM-ee”) is a pain-relieving compound found naturally in the body that helps regulate hormones and maintain cell membranes. Products containing 200 mg SAM-e are appropriate for most dogs weighing more than 15 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Methylsulfonylmethane </strong>(MSM) is a naturally occurring sulfur produced by ocean planktons and which is also found in cow’s milk, meat, sea vegetables, fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Sulfur deficiencies result in canine skin and coat problems, poor gastrointestinal and immune responses, joint pain, and arthritis. MSM supplements are sold as powders and capsules with a recommended dose for dogs of 50 to 100 mg per 10 pounds of body weight.</p>
<p><strong>Salmon and other fish oils</strong> are rich sources of omega-3 fatty acids that reduce inflammation, in contrast to the omega-6 fatty acids in polyunsaturated vegetable oils. Fish oils contain <strong>eicosapentaenoic acid</strong> (EPA) and <strong>docosahexaenoic acid</strong> (DHA), which block inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins and are converted by the body into powerful anti-inflammatory chemicals called resolvins.</p>
<p>Omega-3 supplements with 300 mg combined EPA and DHA are widely prescribed for dogs. Give up to 1 gelcap per 10 pounds of body weight daily or, if using a product containing 500 mg EPA/DHA, give 1 gelcap per 15 to 20 pounds of body weight daily. Adjust liquid fish oil dosages to 300 mg combined EPA/DHA per 10 pounds of body weight. Higher doses can interfere with platelets and increase bleeding as well as increase rather than reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>“You must supplement with vitamin E whenever you give polyunsaturated fatty acids or PUFAs such as fish oils, as otherwise the body will be depleted of this vitamin,” says Straus. “Give a maximum of 7 international units (IUs) per pound of body weight for small dogs and 3 to 4 IUs per pound for large dogs. You can also give equivalent amounts less often. For example, a dog weighing 100 pounds might get as much as 400 IUs daily, while a 10-pound dog could be given a maximum of 200 IUs every three or four days.”</p>
<p><strong>Pancreatin, bromelain, papain, amylase, protease</strong>, and other enzymes are familiar digestive aids that can be added to your dog’s dinner to improve the assimilation of nutrients. Clinical trials and anecdotal reports support the use of digestive enzymes with food, digestive enzymes without food between meals, and enteric-coated enzymes between meals for the treatment of arthritis.</p>
<h3>Natural Remedies for Arthritis in Dogs</h3>
<p>Can adding herbs to your stiff old dog’s dinner help him run, jump, and play like a puppy? Plants were the original pharmacy for humans and animals, and over thousands of years, cultures around the world developed remedies that remain in use today.</p>
<p>Search the medical literature or the websites of educational organizations like the American Botanical Council (herbalgram.com) and you’ll find many studies examining the effect of medicinal plants on humans with arthritis. But while canine arthritis is a popular veterinary research topic, only a few studies have examined plant-based therapies for dogs.</p>
<p>A 2004 Swiss examination of 29 dogs with degenerative osteoarthritis showed that a resin extract of Indian frankincense (<em>Boswellia serrata</em>) significantly reduced symptoms and increased mobility in more than 70% of the canine patients.</p>
<p>In 2014, a randomized placebo-controlled trial at the University of Montreal’s Faculty of Veterinary Medicine tested 32 dogs diagnosed with arthritis by x-ray and orthopedic exams. The researchers developed combinations of devil’s claw root (<em>Harpagophytum procumbens</em>), Indian frankincense, and other herbs, and after eight weeks the strength of dogs receiving treatment improved to the equivalent of a kilo of extra strength per paw. None of the treated dogs saw their health decline, unlike 25.8% of the dogs who were given a placebo. In addition, the placebo dogs became less physically active while the treated dogs became significantly more active.</p>
<p>Popular herbal products for dogs with arthritis include those mentioned above plus cannabis (<em>Cannabis sativa</em>), feverfew (<em>Tanacetum parthenium</em>), turmeric (<em>Curcuma longa</em>), yucca (<em>yucca schidigera</em>), and various Chinese herbal blends. Most pet supply stores and natural food markets sell a variety of herbal products for pets and so do online retailers.</p>
<p>To discover which products work best for your dog, follow label directions and complete one course of treatment (typically four to six weeks) before starting another candidate treatment. Take notes about your dog’s arthritis symptoms, such as her willingness or ability to get in the car or jump up on the couch, or how long it takes her to get on her feet after a nap, before beginning a new remedy and again at weekly intervals.</p>
<p>Another good way to track the effectiveness of a new product is to take a video of your dog walking, turning, or playing before and after a course of treatment.</p>
<h3>Evaluating The Options to Treat Your Dog’s Arthritis</h3>
<p>With dozens of alternatives to choose from, it’s hard to decide what to try for your dog. In 2009 the journal veterinary record assessed the efficacy of therapies used in the management of canine osteoarthrosis based on 68 papers published in peer-reviewed journals. The studies found strong evidence for the efficacy of NSAIDs in treating osteoarthritis. There was moderate support for the efficacy of glycosaminoglycan polysulphate (the injectable drug Adequan), elk antler velvet, and a food containing green-lipped mussel (<em>Perna canaliculus</em>, a natural source of GAGs).</p>
<p>In contrast, the studies found weak or no evidence to support the use of many other treatments. None of the reports offered final answers about what works and what doesn’t, and all of them concluded that additional research is needed.</p>
<p>This review accurately reflects the lack of well-designed research examining the effectiveness of treatments for arthritis in dogs. As new products and procedures are developed, we who love our arthritic dogs will continue to experiment with treatments and combinations of treatments that help our dogs stay active and pain-free through old age.</p>

http://whole-dog-journal.com/rss,Unhealthy Gums? It Could Be Canine Gum Disease,"<p>We often pay attention to our dog’s teeth, but the gums supporting those teeth are just as important. Unfortunately, they’re frequently ignored. As a result, gum disease is epidemic in dogs. Recent studies show that by the time they are two years old, almost 90% of America’s dogs have some type of periodontal disease.</p>
<p>This progressive illness is caused by mouth bacteria that harm gums and bones. Unfortunately, periodontal disease is invisible to the untrained eye until it causes significant damage, so prevention is an important strategy.</p>
<p>The causes of periodontal disease in dogs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>poor dental hygiene</li>
<li>genetics</li>
<li>malocclusion (having a misaligned bite)</li>
<li>the shape of a dog’s mouth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Brachycephalic breeds (those with shortened snouts) and small or toy breeds are at greater risk than other dogs, as are older and overweight dogs in general.</p>
<h3>How periodontal disease in dogs is diagnosed</h3>

<p>Veterinarians diagnose four stages of periodontal disease by checking for abnormal spaces between teeth and gums and by taking x-rays while the dog is under general anesthesia. Without dental x-rays, it’s impossible to accurately diagnose periodontal disease.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 1</strong>, also known as gingivitis, consists of gum inflammation with no bone loss or tooth detachment. The symptoms include red or puffy gums, bad breath, and gums that bleed during chewing or brushing. This is the only periodontal stage that can be reversed; the others cause permanent damage.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 2</strong> produces up to a 25% loss of tooth attachments, mild bone loss, and mildly abnormal periodontal pocket depths, which are spaces around teeth below the gum line. In addition to Stage 1 symptoms, Stage 2 patients have receding gums.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 3</strong> shows a loss of 25 to 50% of the tooth’s support. In addition to the preceding symptoms, this stage results in loose teeth. Advanced dental procedures and daily home care are needed to save affected teeth, which are otherwise pulled at this stage.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 4</strong> is the final and most serious stage of periodontal disease, with X-rays and periodontal probing showing more than 50% loss of tooth attachments. Stage 4 symptoms include tooth root exposure, missing and loose teeth, and pus oozing from around the teeth. The treatment for this phase is tooth extraction, and the prognosis for dogs in this condition is poor.</p>
<p>As periodontal disease in dogs progresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>dogs flinch or pull away when anyone tries to inspect their teeth</li>
<li>their chewing patterns change</li>
<li>they smack their gums</li>
<li>they don’t tolerate having their teeth brushed because the gums are painful</li>
<li>they no longer enjoy playing with chew toys</li>
<li>their behavior may become more withdrawn or aggressive</li>
</ul>
<p>Left untreated, dental disease adversely affects all of the body’s organs, including the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys. The constant release of bacterial infections from the mouth to the rest of the body is a form of systemic poisoning. A study published in the April-June 2021 <em>Open Veterinary Journal </em>found that periodontal disease is associated with cognitive dysfunction in aging dogs. Keeping your dog’s gums healthy makes a rewarding investment in his old age.</p>
<h3>How to Keep Dog’s Gums and Teeth Healthy</h3>
<p>To help prevent oral health problems, check your dog’s mouth for signs of gingivitis, plaque, and tartar. This is easy to do if you brush your dog’s teeth every day. If not, gently lift her upper lip to look at her front and side teeth, then pull the corner of her mouth back so you can see top and bottom teeth further back in her mouth. Repeat on the other side. Frequent checks will call your attention to something that needs immediate attention, such as a broken tooth or something caught between the teeth.</p>
<p>An early symptom of gingivitis is a thin red line along the gumline, which can increase in width if the illness progresses. A thorough exam, including x-rays, will show the extent of periodontal disease and determine appropriate treatment. Prompt veterinary attention can prevent further damage, and your at-home attention will help as well.</p>
<p>Dental plaque is a sticky, colorless biofilm of microorganisms that grows between, in front of, and behind teeth, on chewing surfaces, and along and below the gumline. It continuously forms on tooth enamel and unless removed by brushing, flossing, or other mechanical means, plaque hardens and forms tartar. Also known as dental calculus, tartar builds up on teeth, often turning brown or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Brushing your dog’s teeth can be an important step in preventing the accumulation of plaque and tarter. It’s easier to introduce brushing to puppies and young dogs but even older dogs can learn to sit still for brushing. For an inspiring story about how powerful this home care can bee, see <a href=""/health/save-your-dogs-teeth-with-home-care/"">“Save Your Dog’s Teeth With Home Care,”</a> WDJ December 2014.</p>
<h3>Alternatives to Using a Toothbrush On Your Dog’s Teeth</h3>
<p>If a gentle approach, poultry-flavored toothpaste, and a soft toothbrush convince your dog to go along with brushing, consider supplements that can be added to food or water to address plaque and gingivitis.</p>
<p>Pet water additives sold as breath fresheners claim to enhance digestive health, improve nutrient absorption, and help dogs smell better. A small amount, such as a capful, is added to every bowl of drinking water. Some contain digestive enzymes, micronized minerals, or ingredients known to minimize plaque and tartar buildup.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some of these additives contain xylitol, a no-calorie sweetener that is toxic to dogs. While the small amounts used according to label directions are considered safe for dogs, some veterinarians are concerned that the daily ingestion of xylitol may pose a risk. Check the label to make sure the product you buy does not contain xylitol.</p>
<p>Success depends on the product as well as how it is introduced to your dog; start with smaller-than-recommended quantities and respect your dog’s preferences.</p>
<p>Studies published in the medical literature show that probiotics (“friendly” or beneficial bacteria) can help prevent the buildup of plaque and tartar in humans, leading some manufacturers to create oral health supplements for dogs. No specific strains of probiotics have been proven to remove canine plaque and tarter, but some veterinarians who recommend probiotics for dogs have reported improvement in their patients’ oral health.</p>
<h3>What to Know About Dogs, Bones and Chewing</h3>
<p>Raw bones can clean teeth and gums while providing chewing pleasure and jaw exercise. However, bones can cause broken teeth, especially if their size and shape allow dogs to get them between their molars and crunch down. Marrow bones are a particular risk. Knuckle bones may be safer because of their shape, especially for large dogs and aggressive chewers. For best results, feed raw, fresh bones and remove them once the meat has been eaten, before they dry out. Cooked bones can splinter and are not recommended.</p>
<p>Chew toys can keep your dog busy and some, like <a href=""http://zestypaws.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Zesty Paws Probiotic OraStix</a>, provide beneficial bacteria that support the oral microbiome. <a href=""http://nylabone.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Nylabone Dental Chew Bones</a>, made of a flexible thermoplastic polymer, feature dental tips that reduce plaque and help prevent tarter buildup.

<p>Did you know that the color and condition of your dog’s gums can give you important clues about her health? Paying attention to these indicators can help you recognize and respond to a variety of canine health problems.</p>
<p><strong>Start by identifying what’s normal for your dog:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lift your dog’s upper lip and check the gum above a canine tooth. This color is your dog’s gum-health baseline, so check it often. Most healthy dogs have pink gums, but some breeds naturally have dark or black pigment in their gums or the roof of the mouth. The pink of healthy gums is often described as light, powdery, bubblegum, or the color of cooked shrimp.</li>
<li>If your dog’s gums are naturally black, dark, or heavily pigmented, color changes will be harder to detect. Instead, check your dog’s inner eyelids by gently pulling the eyelid down so you can see the color of the eyelid tissue.</li>
<li>Check your dog’s hydration level by running your finger over the gums, which should be slick, smooth, slippery, or wet, not dry, tacky, or sticky.</li>
<li>Gently press the gum with an index finger. When you release the pressure, the gum will be white or pale pink, and its normal color should return in 1.5 seconds or less. This return to natural color after you press on the gum is called the capillary refill time, or CRT.</li>
<li>A slow CRT, such as 2 seconds or more, can reflect dehydration, poor circulation, low blood pressure, or shock. Shock is the most serious of these conditions. If dehydration symptoms are minor, increase your dog’s water consumption. Serious dehydration requires medical treatment such as subcutaneous fluids.</li>
<li>Keep track of gum color changes, understand their possible causes, and report changes to your veterinarian.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unhealthy dog gum colors </strong></p>
<p>All of the following are serious conditions that require medical attention:</p>

<p><strong>Blue gums</strong> reflect a lack of oxygen in the dog’s blood supply (cyanosis). Pneumonia, congestive heart failure, pulmonary thromboembolism, choking, hypothermia, and other health emergencies can cause this discoloration. A dog with blue gums needs <em>immediate</em> medical attention.</p>
<p><strong>Pale pink or white gums </strong>are a danger sign, reflecting acute blood loss or diseases that cause anemia.</p>
<p><strong>Bright cherry red gums </strong>can indicate overheating or heat stroke, carbon monoxide poisoning, elevated blood pressure, or exposure to toxins. All of these require medical attention. For heat stroke, in addition to contacting your veterinarian, act fast to drizzle cool water over the dog, offer water to drink, wet the paws with cold water, and drape a cool wet towel around the head.</p>
<p><strong>Slightly red gums</strong> can reflect topical irritation, such as that seen in the aftermath of enthusiastically chewing a new toy, or a mouth infection such as gingivitis. These aren’t medical emergencies, but monitor the symptom and check with your veterinarian if it continues.</p>
<p><strong>Bleeding gums, </strong>especially after brushing or vigorous chewing, could result from gingivitis, growths in the mouth, or sensitivity. Emergency treatment may be needed If bleeding lasts more than 10 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Yellow gums </strong>can reflect liver problems, anemia, and/or the destruction of red blood cells.</p>

<p>Anesthesia-free dentals are popular with owners who worry about putting their dogs under anesthesia, but it’s impossible to get even the best-mannered dog to hold still for cleaning their teeth below the gum line – which is the most critical area to clean in order to prevent periodontal disease. Says canine health researcher and owner of the <a href=""http://www.DogAware.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">DogAware.com</a> website Mary Straus, “Anesthesia-free dentals are cosmetic procedures that do not contribute to your dog’s health and may even disguise problems, since the teeth look clean.”</p>

http://whole-dog-journal.com/rss,For Better Dog-Behavior Training: Pretend Your Dog Is a Tiger,"<p>Owners often turn to dog trainers when they’re feeling exasperated. They report that their dog has the following behavior and training issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has no idea how to walk on a leash!</li>
<li>Chews their shoes!</li>
<li>Jumps all over the guests!</li>
<li>Barks wildly at other dogs!</li>
<li>Chases the cat!</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, we trainers have detailed behavior-modification dog training plans for all of those things. But to start with, I like to suggest this all-purpose, magic tip:</p>
<p><em><strong>Pretend you have a tiger, not a dog.</strong> </em></p>
<p>Dog training – like so much of life – is all about expectations. If you’re in the wrong headspace, it’ll ruin any training plan you try. The right mindset is your greatest advantage when it comes to creating a home where you and your dog are living happily together. That’s where the tiger exercise comes in.</p>
<h3>If This Were a Tiger, Would You Be Mad?</h3>

If you adopted a tiger, you’d work incredibly hard to set everyone up for success, always keeping in mind that this is not the tiger’s natural environment. Rather than feeling angry at a chewed shoe, you’d be thrilled it wasn’t worse, reminding yourself to better tiger-proof next time. © Anankkml | Dreamstime.com.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Close your eyes. Think about that last unfortunate incident with your dog. Now, adjust that visualization, and picture your dog as a tiger you took into your home.</p>
<p>How does that tiger alter your reaction? You’d probably feel a little less mad, and it’s likely that your thoughts would shift like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>He has no idea how to walk on a leash.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>“Well of course he doesn’t! It’s amazing we’re out and about together at all, given how unnatural this is for him.”</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>She chews all of our shoes.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>“Good Lord, why did we leave our shoes out where the tiger could get them?”</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>He jumps on the guests.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>“How did we not realize that it was ridiculous to put the tiger in that situation when a tiger’s method of greeting is utterly unlike anything we humans would want to see?”</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>She barks wildly at dogs.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>“It’s natural that she’d have big feelings about those other animals. Clearly we should help her with carefully guided experiences before expecting her to just be chill.”</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>He chases the cat.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>“Why did we let those two species meet and interact without supervision?”</p>
<h3>Don&#8217;t Expect a Dog to Know Our Human Ways</h3>
<p>Obviously, your dog really isn’t a tiger, but every one of the empathetic reactions you’d probably have to a tiger’s behavior is 100% appropriate for a dog. Like captive tigers, dogs are a different species of animal just trying to adjust to living in a human world. Our expectations that dogs should immediately fold into our lives like Lassie are worse than silly; they’re terribly harmful – both to the dogs who are set up to fail and the humans who feel like they’ve blown it because their dogs aren’t perfect.</p>
<p>That’s why it helps to remind yourself (and everyone in your home) that you have a tiger in the house! A tiger is serious business, so:</p>
<p>You’re going to be proactive and set that animal up for success.</p>
<p>You’re going to think hard about how to manage guests.</p>
<p>You’re going to work diligently to tiger-proof the house.</p>
<p>You’re going to expect to be “on duty” when young kids or other animals are around.</p>
<p>You’re going to understand how completely weird all of this is for a creature who’s not in his native habitat, so you’ll expect those bumps in the road.</p>
<p>Finally, realizing you have a tiger who’s missing out on what he’d get if he were out in the wild, you would think like a good zookeeper would. “How can I better meet the needs of this captive animal, who wasn’t designed to Netflix on the couch?”</p>
<h3>How Your Tiger Becomes the Best Dog</h3>
<p>Flipping that mental switch from dog to tiger makes owners smarter, kinder, and more open to problem-solving. Do you know what that kind of nurturing does after a while? It turns that tiger into a dog who’s a pleasure to live with.</p>
<p>Mind you, most owners will still benefit tremendously from a great trainer with a dog behavior modification training plan, now that you have the right mindset. But the best trainer in the world can’t help you when you have impossible expectations about a member of another species who landed in your human home.</p>

http://whole-dog-journal.com/rss,Why Your Dog Licks You – And How to Stop It,"<p>Licking is a natural behavior for dogs. The puppies of wild canids (or feral or street dogs) lick their parents’ mouths, which prompt the parents to regurgitate food for them. Mother dogs also instinctively lick their pups to clean them, and pups lick their moms in return. Licking is also a sign of affection which causes a release of oxytocin; it feels good to the dog who licks as well as the dog who gets licked! Dogs also explore the world with tongue – tasting their surroundings.</p>
<p>But what about licking humans? Yes, your dog may be showing her affection for you when she licks you – and she may be getting a little oxytocin boost as well. She might also lick as an appeasement gesture if she thinks you’re upset with her. She could be attention-seeking, or simply washing off good flavors – anything from that peanut butter on your lips to skin lotion you put on this morning.</p>
<h3>Is a dog licking you dangerous?</h3>
<p>Allowing a dog to lick you, particularly in the face, has the potential to expose you to pathogenic, food-borne bacteria such as Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Pasteurella, as well as Leptospira, the bacteria that causes leptospirosis and is found in the urine or body fluids of infected animals. If you’re confident that your dog has not been exposed to pathogenic bacteria, and are non immune-compromised, you may feel fine about taking those risks. Just remember that dogs also eat yucky stuff, including a variety of animal feces, dead things, and random garbage – and they lick their own nether ends, to keep them tidy. When they lick your face they share all that with you! However, you can minimize the risk by avoiding the dog’s tongue contacting with your mouth and nose.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you use any medicated cream or topical oil, allowing your dog to lick your skin could be harmful to your dog. People who use topical forms of hormones or pain medications should check with their veterinarian before allowing their dogs to lick them. It may be worth asking them about sunscreen and other topicals, too.</p>
<h3>How to stop my dog from licking me</h3>
<p>Fortunately, if you’re not a fan of being licked by your dog, there are a number of gentle methods to discourage this behavior:</p>
<ol>
<li>Give your dog something else to do with her mouth. Preoccupy her tongue with a tasty chewie, a food-stuffed toy, or a snuffle mat.</li>
<li>Teach her to target – and then reward her for touching her nose to targets that are a short distance from your body. (See: <a href=""/training/on-target-training/"">https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/training/on-target-training/</a>)</li>
<li>Enrichment! A tired dog is a happy owner. Mental and physical exercise is likely to reduce her need to lick.</li>
<li>Turn away when she licks. If she’s attention-seeking, pre-empt her licking by giving her attention before the tongue appears. Then turn away if it does.</li>
<li>Change your soap or lotion. Your dog may be attracted to whatever scent you are using; you might find one she likes less.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, if your dog’s licking is excessive, consider whether it could be a symptom of <a href=""/behavior/obsessive-compulsive-behavior-in-dogs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</a>. If that’s the case, you’re best off seeking the assistance of a qualified dog behavior professional to find tactics to discourage your dog’s persistent licking behavior. But if you’re a fan of normal dog licks, go ahead – enjoy those kisses!</p>

http://whole-dog-journal.com/rss,Evolving Use of Trazodone,"<p>Trazodone is an anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) medication that is also used for short-term sedation. It’s not classified as an analgesic (pain-relieving medication), so why are we seeing it prescribed more and more as part of comprehensive, combination pain protocols for dogs?</p>
<p>One possible reason is because pain has an emotional aspect. The somatosensory (physical) component of pain has to do with the location and intensity of pain. The affective (emotional) component is the fear, anxiety, and distress that accompanies physical pain.</p>
<p>Trazodone is a serotonin-modulating drug. It inhibits reuptake of serotonin and blocks serotonin receptor sites, thereby increasing the amount of serotonin available in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter responsible for promoting feelings of calmness and well being. The more serotonin hanging around in your brain, the better, calmer, and less anxious you feel. This is the same for dogs.</p>
<h3>What does trazodone do for dogs?</h3>
<p>Adding trazodone to acute pain protocols for dogs helps manage the affective side of pain. If dogs wake up from a painful surgical procedure with trazodone on board, they suffer less fear and distress associated with any pain they may feel. The sedating effect of trazodone also makes it useful post-operatively for the rest and restricted activity recommended after most surgical procedures. This is especially helpful for young, exuberant dogs.</p>
<p>The same goes for dogs who have to undergo repeated, uncomfortable procedures; this can make dogs suffer fear and anxiety in anticipation of the procedure. A perfect example is frequent bandage changes on a painful wound. Pre-treating with trazodone minimizes the negative emotional experience for these patients, which makes them less likely to anticipate the procedure with fear and anxiety and generally more cooperative throughout the process.</p>
<p>Chronic pain conditions have a huge emotional component, taking their toll over time. Additionally, chronicity is known to increase pain perception sensitivity within the central nervous system. These facts suggest adding trazodone to chronic pain protocols may be helpful as well.</p>
<h3>What does trazodone do for physical pain in dogs?</h3>
<p>Studies have looked at whether trazodone may have its own antinociceptive (pain perception blocking) effect. One such study published in 2021 (“Synergistic interaction between trazodone and gabapentin in rodent models of neuropathic pain,” Garrone et al) looked at trazodone used in combination with gabapentin, a popular neuropathic pain-reliever. The results from this study were suggestive that trazodone does have some antinociceptive effects and that the combination was effective for treating chronic neuropathic pain with no serious adverse effects.</p>
<h3>Side effects for trazodone for dogs</h3>
<p>Trazodone is not addictive and side effects are uncommon, with up to 80% of dogs having none. Reported side effects include mild increased hunger, nausea, and diarrhea. Increased risk of bleeding when used with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) has been reported.</p>
<p>The biggest caution with trazodone comes with using it in combination with other serotonin-enhancing drugs like fluoxetine (Prozac) and clomipramine (Clomicalm), and with tramadol, an opioid pain-reliever. The concern with these combinations is an adverse reaction called serotonin syndrome, where dogs with too much circulating serotonin suffer extreme agitation; generalized tremors; elevated heart rate, temperature, and blood pressure; dilated pupils; and trouble breathing. Serotonin syndrome can be life-threatening, so be sure to tell your veterinarian about all medications your dog is on.</p>
<p>In summary, trazodone is a complex, interesting medication with multiple potential clinical applications in veterinary medicine. There certainly is enough information out there suggesting trazodone may be a useful addition to both acute and chronic comprehensive, combination pain management protocols in dogs.</p>

http://whole-dog-journal.com/rss,Cultural differences (and what are we doing wrong?),"<p>Last month, my sister-in-law and my almost-13-year-old niece, Ava, spent two weeks in France, visiting my sister-in-law’s mother and stepfather, who live in Paris. Ava has been a dog lover since before she could walk, so I gave her an assignment, to take photos of dogs in Paris.</p>
<p>I’ve always been interested in the cultural differences between how dogs are handled and treated in different countries and I discussed this with her a bit; she and her mom stopped at my house on their way to the airport, because I dog-sat their little dog, Alice, while they were gone. But, in truth, I wasn’t actually concerned with the photos that Ava might get for me; I had an ulterior motive. Mostly I was trying to give Ava a photography job that would (I hoped) keep her engaged with the living scenery when traveling, to keep her eyes open. Ava has an artistic eye, and as someone who studied photojournalism, I know that being given an assignment to take pictures can sharpen and focus your awareness on your surroundings.</p>
<p>Ava did take and send me some pictures of dogs and dog owners. We’re going to be looking at them and discussing her trip to France at the end of this week, when our family will get together again to celebrate her 13<sup>th</sup> birthday. But here’s the funny thing: Ava must have told her grandmother that she was taking photos of dogs for me. This morning I received a photo and email from her grandmother, Olivia.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_576020"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-576020"" style=""width: 225px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><img class=""wp-image-576020 size-medium"" src=""https://s28489.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Paris_dogwalkerIMG-2152-225x300.jpg"" alt=""dog walker in france"" width=""225"" height=""300"" srcset=""https://s28489.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Paris_dogwalkerIMG-2152-225x300.jpg.webp 225w, https://s28489.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Paris_dogwalkerIMG-2152.jpg.webp 270w"" sizes=""(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-576020"" class=""wp-caption-text"">© Whole Dog Journal</figcaption></figure>
<p>“I heard you need pictures of dogs in France,” Olivia explained. Well, I guess my covert mission needed to be exposed, and I’ve written back to Olivia to recuse her from the assignment and sharing the <em>actual</em> purpose of my assignment for Ava with her.</p>
<p>But after writing the email, I looked at Olivia’s snapshot again. She had actually captured several very interesting things. The longer I look at this photo, which she captioned as “a dog walker in Paris,” the more I see. Look: What do you see?</p>

<p>Here are the things that are most interesting to me:</p>
<p>Of the seven dogs visible in the photo, only one (possibly two) is leashed. Despite this, they are all just hanging out in a relaxed fashion, waiting for their walker, who appears to be taking a snack break.</p>
<p>The two dogs on the right may or may not be with the walker; they are slightly removed from her, whereas the other dogs are arranged in a circle around her. So those two unleashed dogs may simply be waiting for their owners to come out of the store or restaurant. They are unleashed but perfectly safe and comfortable waiting on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>All but one of the dogs resemble purebreds. The dog on the far right might be, too; I’m not familiar enough with all the bully-type breeds to know what she is or might be.</p>
<p>All seven of the dogs are in good weight and look fit. Even French <em>dogs</em> look more slender than their American counterparts!</p>
<p>The white dog on the right appears to be a French Bulldog – but he or she has much more of a nose than the French Bulldogs you see here. I love that the dog’s face isn’t as smushed in the exaggerated way the dogs here often appear.</p>
<p>How do dogs become so habituated and well-behaved that they can safely be taken out with a dog-walker off leash in the middle of a busy city? Are dogs being lost and hit by cars at a rate we Americans would find unacceptable? I’m fascinated – and I just might have to go to Paris to find out! I’m pretty sure I could stay with Olivia…</p>

http://whole-dog-journal.com/rss,Are Eggs Good for Dogs?,"<p>Dogs have been stealing eggs for thousands of years, and for good reason. Eggs from chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, quail, and other birds are safe, nutrition-boosting additions to any dog’s diet. They can be served raw or cooked, alone or combined with other foods. It’s hard to go wrong with these convenient, affordable, versatile ingredients.</p>
<p>Eggs are high in nutrients that support every part of the canine body. The yolks contain the egg’s vitamins and fatty acids, the whites are almost pure protein, and the shells contain calcium carbonate with a few other minerals. Eggs can be added to dry, canned, frozen, or refrigerated dog foods, fed as between-meal snacks, or used as training treats.</p>
<p>The average large chicken egg (the size sold in most markets) contains 72 calories, 6 grams of protein, and 5 grams of fat. How often and how many eggs to feed depends on your dog’s size, health, condition, and activity level. Some dogs are allergic to eggs but for most dogs, eggs are a tasty and nutritious food.</p>
<p>The US Department of Agriculture recommends storing eggs in their cartons in the coldest part of your refrigerator (not the door) at 40 degrees F or slightly below that. Properly stored raw eggs last three to five weeks from the time you bring them home. After cooking, refrigerated hard-boiled eggs last safely for a week.</p>
<h3>How much egg should you feed to your dog?</h3>
<p>Individual reactions vary, so start with a small amount and, if you have questions or health concerns, check with your veterinarian. Add a hard-boiled egg or part of one to your pup’s dinner or offer it as a treat and pay attention to her response. Most dogs will want more, and that’s a good sign. If your dog shows any symptoms of indigestion or an allergic reaction, check with your veterinarian.</p>
<p>Assuming your dog enjoys her egg, wait a day or two before offering another. The egg can be poached, fried in a small amount of oil or butter, scrambled, hard-boiled, or soft-boiled.</p>
<p>Canine nutrition researcher Mary Straus at dogaware.com says, “Dogs weighing 40 pounds or more can handle a whole egg, so I’d recommend half an egg (or a whole egg every other day) for dogs weighing 20 to 40 pounds and proportionately less for smaller dogs.”</p>
<h3>Can dogs eat raw eggs?</h3>
<p>Because raw eggs are associated with salmonella, a bacterial infection that causes fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy, most veterinarians recommend that eggs be cooked before feeding to your dog. However, many dog owners feed their dogs raw eggs with no ill effects, and veterinarians who promote raw diets claim that the benefit of raw eggs are that they are more nutritious than cooked eggs and that they are usually safe for dogs to eat. Factory farms, in which thousands of chickens are housed close together, are blamed for salmonella outbreaks, while chickens raised outdoors on a small scale are unlikely to be infected.</p>
<p>Another argument against feeding raw eggs is that egg whites contain an enzyme that prevents the absorption of the B vitamin biotin, potentially leading to a deficiency that adversely affects skin, coat, and nail health. However, egg yolks contain large amounts of biotin, so feeding the entire egg eliminates that risk. Biotin deficiencies, while theoretically possible, are rare in dogs.</p>
<p>The easiest way to give your dog a raw egg is to crack one over his dinner.</p>
<h3>Can dogs eat eggshells?</h3>
<p>Eggshells contain approximately 2,000 mg of elemental calcium per shell, enough to meet the daily needs of an 85-pound dog. Home-prepared diets for dogs that do not include raw bone need to be supplemented with a calcium source, and many people use eggshells for this purpose. The shells should be ground to a powder in a clean coffee grinder or blender.</p>
<p>It’s important to provide a calcium source in your dog’s home-prepared diet –but it’s equally important to provide enough and not too much. To calculate the appropriate amount of eggshells to use as a calcium source for a homemade diet, please see <a href=""/food/calcium-in-homemade-dog-food/"">“Calcium in Homemade Dog Food,”</a> WDJ May 2019.</p>
<p>Eggshell powder should never be added to the diet of dogs already eating a nutritionally complete commercial diet, as they will end up receiving far too much calcium. Large-breed puppies in particular can be harmed by excess calcium, especially during the first six months when they’re growing rapidly and aren’t able to control their calcium uptake.</p>
<h3>What’s the difference between factory farmed, free-range, and pastured eggs?</h3>
<p>The nutritional value of eggs depends on the health of the birds that lay them.</p>
<p>According to <a href=""http://www.ffacoalition.org"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Factory Farm Awareness Coalition</a>, most layer hens in the United States spend the bulk of their lives, about <a href=""https://livestock.extension.wisc.edu/articles/life-cycle-of-a-laying-hen/"">two or three years</a>, in closely stacked cages in concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). Layer hens are bred to lay more than <a href=""https://sentientmedia.org/chicken-farm/"">300 eggs</a> a year. In crowded cages, hens are <a href=""https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/cage-free-vs-battery-cage-eggs"">unable</a> to spread their wings, take dust baths, perch, nest, or lay eggs as they would in nature. When their egg production declines, they are sent to a slaughterhouse.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines “free range” chickens as those having access to the outdoors for at least some part of the day, whether the chickens choose to go outside or not. There are no requirements for length of time the chicken must spend outdoors, the size of the outdoor area, or the type of groundcover. Less than 1% of chickens nationwide are raised as “free range.” The remaining 99% spend their lives confined to indoor pens.</p>
<p>The terms “pastured” and “pasture-raised” apply to farm animals that live in grassy fields. While there is no legal definition for the term, pastured chickens are ideally raised on deep-rooted green grass and moved every few days to fresh areas. They are physically active and consume a variety of seeds, insects, worms, and other live foods that they forage themselves.</p>
<p>Small local farms, farmer’s markets, and natural food stores are great sources for maximally nutritious eggs from healthy chickens, ducks, and other birds. Their nutritional quality is reflected in their dark orange yolks and hard shells, and they’re as good for you as they are for your dog.</p>
<p>To find pastured eggs locally and to learn how pastured chicken and their eggs are raised, search online for “pastured eggs” in your area and visit websites such as <a href=""http://www.eatwild.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">eatwild.com</a>, <a href=""http://www.getrealchicken.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">getrealchicken.com</a>, <a href=""http://www.theveggan.com/pasture-raised-egg-brands"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">theveggan.com/pasture-raised-egg-brands</a>, and <a href=""http://www.localharvest.org"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">localharvest.org</a>. Prices vary by region, but the public’s growing support for pasture-raised poultry, the increasing availability of pastured eggs, and their affordability provide an important nutritional bonus for our best friends.</p>

http://whole-dog-journal.com/rss,Do Dogs Need Sunscreen?,"<p>On sunny days, we rub sunscreen on ourselves and our kids, but what about our dogs? Should we protect them, too? Yes! – some dogs absolutely benefit from sunscreen!</p>
<h3>What dogs need sunscreen?</h3>
<p>Hairless breeds, dogs with white or thin coats, and dogs with pink or light-pigmented noses and eyelids are at higher risk of sunburn and sun damage than other dogs. So are dogs experiencing hair loss from seasonal shedding, shaving, or health conditions that cause coat thinning. And dogs with “snow nose,” a seasonal pigment change from black to pink, may need winter sun protection.</p>
<h3>What sunscreen is safe for dogs?</h3>
<p>Sunscreen made specifically for dog is safe for dogs. Unheard of a few decades ago, sun protection products for dogs are widely sold as lotions, sprays, sticks, balms, ointments, and clothing. Some brands claim an “SPF equivalent” rating that compares their products to human sunscreens, such as SPF 15, 30, or 40.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_575948"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-575948"" style=""width: 176px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-575948"" src=""https://s28489.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nose_sunscreen-1-176x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""176"" height=""300"" srcset=""https://s28489.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nose_sunscreen-1-176x300.jpg.webp 176w, https://s28489.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nose_sunscreen-1-602x1024.jpg.webp 602w, https://s28489.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nose_sunscreen-1-768x1306.jpg.webp 768w, https://s28489.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nose_sunscreen-1-904x1536.jpg.webp 904w, https://s28489.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nose_sunscreen-1-300x510.jpg.webp 300w, https://s28489.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nose_sunscreen-1-600x1020.jpg.webp 600w, https://s28489.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nose_sunscreen-1-696x1183.jpg.webp 696w, https://s28489.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nose_sunscreen-1-247x420.jpg.webp 247w, https://s28489.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nose_sunscreen-1-400x680.jpg.webp 400w, https://s28489.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nose_sunscreen-1.jpg.webp 1000w"" sizes=""(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px"" /><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-575948"" class=""wp-caption-text"">Some dogs need sunscreen only where their hair is thin and their skin is pink, like on the bridge of this dog’s nose. ©Nancy Kerns</figcaption></figure>
<p>Dog-safe sunscreens do not contain zinc oxide or para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), which are commonly found in human sunscreens and which are toxic to dogs.</p>
<p>When comparing products, look for sunscreens that match your dog’s lifestyle. Some have to be applied 15 to 20 minutes before sun exposure, while quick-drying sprays offer instant protection. Waterproof products are recommended for swimming dogs.</p>
<p>If your dog has sensitive skin, test new products for allergic reactions by applying sunscreen to a small area of bare skin. Check it after 24 to 48 hours for signs of irritation and if it causes a reaction, try a different product.</p>
<p>If your dog’s skin proves too sensitive for any topical sunscreen product, look for sun shirts or sun suits for dogs that cover most of the body. Some protective clothing also repels mosquitoes and other insects. Hats and goggles designed for canine use can be useful as well.</p>
<h3>How to protect your dog from the sun</h3>
<p>There are two main ways to protect your dog from the sun: dog-safe sunscreen and avoid or limiting intense sun exposure.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dog sunscreen: Labels indicate how often a sunscreen should be reapplied. Apply sunscreen to areas that will be most exposed to sunlight, yet avoiding eye areas:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>the bridge and tip of your dog’s nose</li>
<li>ear tips</li>
<li>skin around the lips</li>
<li>inner thigh</li>
<li>groin</li>
<li>wherever pigmentation is light</li>
</ul>
<p>If using a lotion that needs time to be absorbed, keep your dog distracted (so he doesn’t lick it off) by playing in the shade or indoors.</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>Limit sun exposure: Avoid or limit activities during the sun’s most intense exposure times, which are mid-day between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. Whenever possible, keep your dog in the shade during those hours – and as much as your dog may enjoy soaking up some rays, don’t let your dog lie in the sun, especially on concrete or light-colored surfaces.</li>
</ol>
<h3>How to treat sunburn on dogs</h3>
<p>Sunburns develop when dogs are overexposed to ultraviolet light; this can happen in as little as half an hour of sun exposure. Whenever you notice reddened, flaking, or warm-feeling skin, bring your dog indoors or into the shade. Treat your dog with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cool water</li>
<li>cool compresses,</li>
<li>dog-safe soothing ointments</li>
<li>aloe vera gel (can help relieve initial sunburn symptoms</li>
</ul>
<p>Call your veterinarian if the burn is serious. Sunburns worsen allergic dermatitis, autoimmune skin conditions, and mange, and sunlight can trigger discomfort or complications at surgery sites. Any dog with a history of sunburn should be protected from future sun exposure to prevent complications.</p>

http://whole-dog-journal.com/rss,How to Identify Tick Bites,"<p>It’s been a long day and you’re finally enjoying some quiet time with your dog. Your fingers are coursing through his coat when you feel a small lump on his skin. Parting his fur, you find something fastened to your dog’s skin that looks like a tick. But how do you know it’s a tick?</p>
<p>If a tick has been attached to your dog for more than a day or two, it will be engorged with your dog’s blood. Engorged ticks will have a gray, oval-shaped body with a brown or black head and legs – but note that when a tick is biting and attached to your dog, you won’t be able to see its head. Using a magnifying glass – or perhaps just the zoom feature on your cell phone – you may be able to see a row of waving legs on either side of the engorged body (ticks have eight legs, with four on either side of their bodies, like spiders). If the tick has only recently bitten your dog, it may be as small as the kernel inside a sunflower seed; if it’s been attached for longer, it may be as plump as a grape.</p>
<p>Be cautious if you’ve found a small brown, black, or pink lump on the underside of your dog’s chest or belly; it might be a nipple! Both male and female dogs have nipples. If you are not sure if what you have found is a tick, please contact your veterinarian. They may ask you to send them a picture of what you have found.</p>
<h3>What are the different types of ticks found on dogs?</h3>

<p>There are a number of species of ticks that are frequently found on dogs; most common are “deer ticks” (also informally called black-legged ticks) and “dog ticks” (<em>Dermacentor variabilis</em>, also called American Dog Ticks, and Brown Dog Ticks, <em>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</em>). Deer ticks are small – before they’ve had a blood meal, they may be as small as a poppy seed. Dog ticks are larger, perhaps as broad as a single pea (though nearly flat before they’ve fed). Depending on the species, dog ticks may have a plain brown body or be brown with red-dotted bodies and a grey “shield” on the back of its “neck” area. Each species of tick carries different bacterial species <a href=""/health/tick-borne-diseases-in-dogs/"">that can cause disease</a> in the animals that the tick feeds on.</p>
<p>Ticks await their prey by climbing onto grass, trees, and brush and quickly grab onto anything that brushes by them. They can crawl pretty rapidly through your dog’s fur – or equally fast up the leg of your pants!</p>
<p>Ideally, dog owners groom their dogs after they’ve been in any environment frequented by ticks. Brush your dog while looking for any loose or attached ticks – or use a brush and a tape roller in alternating strokes, to loosen and then capture any crawling ticks.</p>
<h3>What to do with an attached tick on your dog</h3>

<p>Don’t delay if you find a tick attached to your dog. <a href=""/care/how-to-remove-a-tick-from-a-dog/"">Remove it right away</a> with a pair of tweezers or use a tick removal tool, such as the Tick Twister, Tick Tornado, or our favorite, the Pro-Tick Remedy. Tick removal tools are available for purchase online or at your favorite pet supply retailer. (See our review of tick-removing tools, <a href=""/health/how-to-get-the-tick-out/"">“How to Get the Tick Out,”</a> WDJ July 2019.)</p>
<p>Tick removal tools come with instructions on how to remove the tick. If you are using tweezers, hold the tweezers parallel to the skin. Grasp the head of the tick as close to the skin as possible. Pull the tick straight up and away from the skin to remove it.</p>
<p>Once the tick is removed, place the tick in rubbing alcohol or a zipper storage bag and discard it in the trash. You may also flush the tick down the toilet. Do not squeeze the tick! Squeezing the tick could expose you and your dog to the bacteria contained within it.</p>
<h3>What to do after the tick is gone from your dog</h3>
<p>The dog’s skin where the tick was attached may become raised and red. A scab may develop over the tick attachment site and remain there for a few days. These spots do not typically become infected and do not require an antibiotic cream or ointment. Contact your veterinarian if the tick attachment site grows larger or develops a yellow or green discharge.</p>
<p>Dogs do not develop the red, bullseye rash that some humans do when they have been bitten by a tick that transmitted Lyme disease. However, dogs will sometimes develop a red bullseye lesion about ½-inch in diameter when they have been bitten by black flies or horse flies. These are usually seen on the underbelly of the dog where their fur is thinner and the skin is easier to see. These lesions are typically not itchy and will resolve on their own in a few days.</p>
<p>If you found an attached tick – and especially if you found more than one attached tick – have your dog tested for Lyme and the other tick-borne diseases that are prevalent in your area about four to six weeks after you have removed the tick/s. Talk to your veterinarian about what high quality flea/tick preventative they recommend and use that preventative all year, even in winter. Adult ticks remain active during the winter months in most areas of the United States.</p>

http://whole-dog-journal.com/rss,The New Dog and “Youngest Child Syndrome”,"<p>I’m the youngest in my family of origin. My siblings are seven, six, and five years older than me. When I became an adult, my mom said to me more than once, “I hardly remember raising you!” – and the funny thing is, I’m not certain she did! When I was little, it was my middle sister Susan who told me to take showers, brush my teeth, brush my hair, and put on clean clothes in the morning. When I was in high school and she was in college, she was the one asked about the courses I was taking (and what grades I was getting) and talked to me about college. It seems to me that by the time I came along, my parents were tired of raising kids to the high standards they had when my older siblings were little – there are no photographs of <em>me</em> in pristine red velvet dresses with white lace collars and black patent-leather shoes, standing alongside my brother, resplendent in his tiny red velvet suit jacket with matching shorts! There are hardly any pictures of me when I was little at all!</p>
<p>It just occurred to me that other day that I have unwittingly replicated this pattern with my current dogs.</p>
<p>When I first adopted Otto from my local shelter in June 2008, he was about 7 months old. I had been editing WDJ for 10 years at that point, and had learned a lot about care and feeding and training with positive reinforcement. As a “crossover trainer” (someone who originally learned about training dogs with a lot of yanking on choke chains), I was eager to train my new dog “from scratch” as a new convert to positive training. Otto had some behavioral quirks, and I read everything about modifying his anxious behaviors to maximize his confidence. I paid exquisite attention to his diet, vaccinations, dental health – you name it. (This is the canine equivalent of parenting those perfectly coiffed kids in their matching red-velvet outfits and glossy patent-leather shoes.)</p>
<p>When I “foster failed” with Woody in January 2016, I felt a <em>strong</em> responsibility to make sure that my new bully-breed-mix developed into a social dog who would be safe with humans of any and all descriptions. I enrolled him in puppy kindergarten and puppy socials and took pains to introduce him to all kinds of different people and places.</p>
<p>This became my most urgent priority when my friendly, happy-go-lucky puppy entered adolescence and started displaying behaviors that revealed new apprehensions about meeting unfamiliar humans. When he hit about 7 or 8 months old, my super-socialized, confident puppy began hanging back from meeting new people, growling while wagging his tail, with the hair on the back of his neck and shoulders raised. Piloerection (the proper name for that raised hair) is the most compelling evidence that his behavior was due to anxiety; dogs can’t <em>intentionally</em> raise their hackles! (It’s an involuntary response of the sympathetic nervous system associated with a number of emotional states, including fear, arousal, insecurity, defensiveness, and unfamiliarity.)</p>
<p>For our first three years together, I took Woody everywhere, while micromanaging his meetings with anyone new, to make sure he was always comfortable and never scared. Eventually, about 95% of his anxiety when meeting new people has dissipated. Given his size, strength, and intimidating appearance (in the opinion of some people), I <em>still</em> strive to make sure that he’s never put in a position to be scared of humans and that no one is frightened of him, so that all parties concerned can behave normally and not freak each other out.</p>
<p>In other words, I “parented” the heck out of my first two dogs.</p>
<p>Which brings me to Boone – the youngest child in the family. Somehow, with the demands of work, family-related travel, and Covid, I never got him signed up for puppy classes or puppy socials (he attended two puppy socials with a friend who was thinking about adopting him, back when I was still on the fence about keeping him). I keep saying I will sign up for an adolescent dog training class, but haven’t yet! (I have more travel on the horizon! And my son’s wedding coming up! And likely more excuses!)</p>

<p>By this age, Otto and Woody both had snappy sits, solid downs, and reliable recalls. They walked nicely with me on leash and off. And speaking of “Off,” we worked on this behavior all the time, so when we saw a snake on the trail, I could ask them to “leave it” and knew that they would come <em>right</em> back to me on cue. Oy! Boone has a nice sit and down, and comes when I call when he’s out wandering around my property, but we’ve barely worked on any formal behaviors.</p>

<p>And yet, with barely any training or conscious socializing at all, he’s done just <em>fine</em> anywhere I’ve taken him, from a dog-related conference at a hotel in the San Francisco Bay Area, to friends’ houses in towns and the country, in cars, trucks, and elevators. He walks nicely on leash – even though I have worked on this behavior only twice that I can recall. No matter where we go or what we do, he’s relaxed, confident, and friendly – with only one exception: He has a tendency to be “guardy” about high-value food around other dogs, so I manage any situation where I have food and other dogs are present fairly assiduously. Other than that he’s been easy-peasy!</p>
<p>I’m not <em>proud</em> of the fact that Boone is growing up with little planned education or checklisted socialization plans – but I am pleased with how he’s turning out, regardless. I think I have to give all the credit to middle-child Woody for raising this puppy!</p>

http://whole-dog-journal.com/rss,On Guard – What to Do When Your Dog Starts Resource Guarding,"<p><span class=""Apple-converted-space"">I </span>confess: Every once in a while, I take advantage of my role as WDJ’s editor and ask an author to write about something that I, personally, need to learn about for the health of my own dog or dogs. There is an article in this <em>very</em> issue that meets this description.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>
<p>Nope, it’s not the one that my new puppy modeled for (that’s Boone on page 8, hanging out in our outdoor kennel). I have long used a kennel to contain stray dogs (while looking for their owners) and for litters of foster puppies (when I have them). And I’ve long been a fan of teaching my dogs to chill and <em>be</em> chill when kept in short-term confinement in a kennel.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>
<p>But this <em>does</em> concern Boone. For months now, he’s been exhibiting a behavior that none of my other dogs have ever been prone to: resource-guarding. And the first time I saw it was sort of dramatic.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>
<p>One day, when Boone was about 14 weeks old, I was helping an 84-year-old friend with the 10-month-old Border Collie she had recently adopted from our local shelter (that’s a story for another day). After a session of showing my friend how to improve her dog’s on-leash behavior by engaging and rewarding the dog’s attention while walking off-leash (one of my favorite training techniques), I asked my friend if she’d like her pup to play with my pup. I let Boone out of my office, and the two young dogs started to romp and wrestle. It was all fun and games, until my friend happened to give Boone a treat when he approached her in greeting.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>
<p>In his aroused state, he immediately decided my friend and her treats were a resource that were well-worth guarding from the visiting dog – her own dog! – and he went from playful to hostile in a split second. He spun around and went <em>right</em> after the little Border Collie, growling and snarling. She ran away, yelping, and he came right back to stand guard next to my astonished friend, wagging his tail but with all his fur standing on end. “Don’t worry, ma’am, our treats are safe from that dog!”</p>
<p>Fortunately, I knew enough not to punish Boone. I picked him up and carried him back to my office to let him calm down. No harm was done, the young dogs have played together without incident (and without treats on hand!) several times since then, and I now have knowledge about Boone that I need to be aware of. And, boy, am I conscious about this, because the <em>last</em> thing in the world I want is for Boone to covet and make a play for anything that rightfully belongs to the king of the castle, my senior dog, Otto. I asked WDJ’s Training Editor, Pat Miller to write the article about <a href=""/behavior/resource-guarding-in-puppies/"">resource-guarding in puppies;</a> I’ve learned a lot, and it has really helped. I hope it helps you, too.</p>

http://additudemag.com/rss,“These Classroom Accommodations Really Helped My Child”,"<p>Effective classroom accommodations vary from child to child, grade to grade, and sometimes teacher to teacher. A daydreamer may benefit from working collaboratively with other students, whereas a hyperactive student may need movement breaks and special “jobs” around the classroom. Abbreviated homework assignments may help students; others may need quiet rooms for test taking. To find the right fit, seek input from your child, their teacher, their healthcare provider, and other caregivers of children with ADHD.</p>

http://additudemag.com/rss,Study: Cognitive Flexibility Improved by ADHD Stimulant Medication Use,"<p><em>August 11, 2022</em></p>
<p>Stimulant medication use may significantly improve learning and executive functioning skills in children with ADHD, who typically experience limited <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/cognitive-flexibility-adhd-children/"">cognitive flexibility</a> compared to their peers. This finding comes from a study published in <em>Molecular Psychiatry</em> that found regional neural flexibility may be predictive of ADHD and symptom severity.<sup><a href=""#footnote1"">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Neural flexibility refers to the brain dynamics thought to underlie cognitive flexibility, or “the ability to selectively switch between mental processes.” Researchers studied the neural flexibility of 180 <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-in-children-symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/"">children with ADHD</a> and 180 typically developing children (TDC) using fMRI and machine learning methods. Compared to the TDC group, decreased neural flexibility was observed in the ADHD group at both the whole brain and sub-network levels, suggesting “a system-wide dynamic reconﬁguration in ADHD rather than a disruption limited to speciﬁc sub-systems,” according to the researchers.</p>
<p>“Neural ﬂexibility not only potentially links to cognitive ﬂexibility, but also has been reported to predict learning outcomes and <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/7-executive-function-deficits-linked-to-adhd/"">executive functions</a> in healthy subjects,” the researchers wrote. “Therefore, neural ﬂexibility might be a useful metric to reﬂect impaired cognitive ﬂexibility in ADHD subjects.”</p>
<p>The effects of <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/stimulant-medications-for-adhd/"">stimulant medication</a> on children with ADHD indicated a significant improvement in cognitive functioning. Among the 180 children with ADHD, 46 were identified as using stimulant medication. Whole brain neural flexibility was significantly higher for the medicated ADHD group compared to the non-medicated ADHD group. No statistical difference was found between the TDC and medicated ADHD group, suggesting that neural flexibility may be used as a sensitive metric “revealing the alterations of intrinsic brain function in response to stimulant medication.”</p>
<p>“Since psychostimulant medications were withheld 24 to 48 hours prior to scanning, the observed &#8216;recovery&#8217; of neural ﬂexibility in the medication group may reﬂect the long-term beneﬁt of stimulant medication to brain function.”</p>
<p>Finally, researchers compared regional neural flexibility between the ADHD and TDC groups. They were able to identify key regions of the brain “capable of distinguishing TDC from ADHD, and predicting severity of <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-symptoms-checklist/"">ADHD symptoms</a>.”</p>
<p>Data was sourced from a publicly available, multi-site ADHD dataset. Due to the limited availability of female subjects, only males were considered in the machine learning models.</p>
<p>“Currently, clinical <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-testing-diagnosis-guide/"">ADHD diagnosis</a> mainly relies on behavioral assessments after symptoms onset and have potential rater bias during implementation. Our ﬁndings could potentially inform efforts at earlier detection for vulnerable youth.”</p>

http://additudemag.com/rss,How to Set Intentions to Crush Procrastination,"<p>Contrary to rampant misperceptions, procrastination is not a time-management problem. Procrastination is an emotion-management problem. Procrastinators use avoidance to cope with negative feelings around a task — and about themselves.</p>
<p>In a way, we can think of procrastination as that petulant 6-year-old, alive and well in all of us, whose catchphrase is, “I don’t wanna!” Daily planners, timers, and similar tools, although necessary, are not sufficient to address the underlying emotional issues behind needless stalling and delaying.</p>
<p>Setting intentions that specify where and when we’re going to do a task (also known as implementation intentions) is one overlooked but effective strategy to decrease procrastination. Concrete <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/daily-structure-intentions-adhd-brain/"">intentions</a> help mitigate frustration and overwhelm around an undesirable task, and they carve out a clearer path forward.</p>
<h2>How to Set Intentions for ADHD Brains</h2>
<p>To reduce procrastination, build your intentions around conditional statements like, “If/when I am in situation X, then I will do Y.” Putting the cue for action into the environment like this (in situation X) is very helpful for getting outside of our habits and even <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/healthy-habits-adult-adhd-focus/"">establishing new habits</a>. Research has shown that these implementation intentions are most effective when we consider the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time</strong>: Too often, we banish undesirable tasks to “some time tomorrow,” “over the weekend,” or “soon.” Vague, poorly defined time frames relieve us of accountability – we feel no pressure to live up to the plan. We can think of these as anemic intentions. They lack strength or motivational force. Instead, specify a time and place when you intend to act – something like “this Saturday morning at 10 a.m.” – to tackle the task.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental cue</strong>: Research shows that specifying a cue for an action (the “X” in the statement above) increases follow-through<sup><a href=""#footnote1"">1</a></sup>. Think: “This Saturday morning, when I have finished my coffee (the cue), I will do Y.” Another benefit of an environmental cue is that it frees up working memory, a known deficit in <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-adhd-symptoms-causes-treatments/"">attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</a>. If the cue is an event that will undoubtedly occur, you don’t have to work so hard to remember it.</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong>: Avoid broad, abstract actions like, “I am going to finish the project.” Instead, state specific actions like, “I will read the next five pages.” Concreteness is an important aspect of effective intentions. Vague actions often add confusion and increase feelings of <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/slideshows/how-to-get-things-done-with-adhd/"">overwhelm</a> around a task. It’s also difficult to feel a sense of accomplishment, or to hold ourselves accountable, for vaguely defined actions. In addition, a concrete action, no matter how small, brings the task to the present and adds a sense of urgency to it, making it more likely that you&#8217;ll act on it today. Even a little bit of progress on a goal is enough to feed motivation and make us feel good. Clearly delineated actions also give you the license to stop – if you don’t feel like doing more, you don’t have to.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Hard Truth of Procrastination</h2>
<p>Just because we set intentions, complete with specific cues and concrete actions, that doesn’t mean that we’ll always feel up to the task. The 6-year-old inside all of us fights hard to avoid <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-emotion-setback-to-positive-energy/"">frustration</a>, so we have to expect to feel this resistance and act whether or not that 6-year-old feels like it. We don’t have to “be in the mood” or “to feel like it” to take action. As one person wrote to me: “For a chronic procrastinator, that’s a bitter pill to swallow. But I’ve found that the more I embrace this hard fact of life and put it into practice, the less I allow my anxiety, frustration, and craving for immediate mood fixes to dictate my actions in the moment.”</p>

http://additudemag.com/rss,Intention Deficit Disorder: Why ADHD Minds Struggle to Meet Goals with Action,"<h2>What Is Intention Deficit Disorder?</h2>
<p>Intention deficit disorder is not a real diagnosis but a term I used to describe what I believe is a central struggle of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): difficulty in accomplishing one’s goals.</p>
<p>Think of ADHD as a performance disorder. People with ADHD know what they need to do, but they struggle – greatly, at times – to transform intention into action, whether that’s preparing for a test or finalizing an important project at work. It’s an issue directly tied to the <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/7-executive-function-deficits-linked-to-adhd/"">executive function</a> difficulties inherent in ADHD. And yet, this very real challenge of ADHD is often mistaken for laziness and <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/when-adhd-leads-to-lack-of-motivation-how-to-get-work-done/"">lack of motivation</a>, which many breed low self-esteem and even depression.</p>
<h2>Unpacking Intention Deficit Disorder: The ADHD Struggle to Perform</h2>
<h3>1. Executive Dysfunction Affects Behavior and Performance</h3>
<p>The self-regulation problems inherent in ADHD stem from deficits in executive function, or the mental skills that allow us to initiate and carry out actions toward a future goal.</p>
<p>The executive system lives in the brain’s frontal lobe, and it is responsible for putting into action the knowledge that lives in the back of the brain. But ADHD separates these two parts of the brain like a meat cleaver.</p>
<p>In ADHD brains, intention and action are disconnected. This is why people with ADHD seem unlikely, unable, or unwilling to carry out behaviors that they know may be good for them. It is also why they are often unable to act effectively on what they know.</p>
<p><em>[<a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/executive-function-deficit-adhd-symptoms-test-for-adults/?src=embed_link"">Take This Self-Test: Executive Function Deficits</a>]</em></p>
<h3>2. Executive Dysfunction Muddles Time</h3>
<p>Executive dysfunction also creates issues with time, timing, and timeliness of behavior. People with ADHD are often “<a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/slideshows/stop-wasting-time/"">time blind</a>,” and they struggle to organize large, hierarchically sequenced behavior across time.</p>
<h3>3. Intention Deficit Turns Everything Into a Crisis</h3>
<p>As people with ADHD are nearsighted to time, they will often wait until the future is imminent to take action. That means that so long they perceive the future to be “out there,” an I-don’t-have-to-deal-with-it-yet outlook will prevail. Hence the almost universal experience of procrastination.</p>
<p>This far-away feeling of future events often means that people with ADHD are often only able to take action at the 11th hour, when time is all but running out. In a race to make a deadline, they may put things together in a slapdash manner. Or they may deliver high-quality work – at the cost of burnout and exhaustion.</p>
<p>The inability to organize and prioritize to the delayed future means that everything inevitably becomes a crisis with a too-near deadline.</p>
<p><em>[<a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/achieving-personal-goals-adhd/?src=embed_link"">Read: 6 Secrets to Goal Setting with ADHD</a>]</em></p>
<h3>4. Intention Deficit Looks Like Laziness</h3>
<p>Future-directed behavior is intentional behavior. When there’s often a sizable gap between intention and action, the term “intention deficit disorder” feels more accurate than “attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,” I think.</p>
<p>But those without ADHD often have very little patience for the short-sighted decisions of individuals with ADHD. They view these outcomes as avoidable, and attribute them to laziness, carelessness, poor <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/time-management-skills-adhd-brain"">time-management</a>, lack of motivation, and moral failure instead of what it really is: executive dysfunction.</p>
<h2>Intention Deficit Disorder: Turning Intention Into Action</h2>
<p>Many people mistakenly believe that skill-building – in the form of time-management tips, self-motivation skills, etc. – will help people with ADHD bridge the gap between intention and action.</p>
<p>But in the field of neuropsychology, we know that the best way to treat a performance (i.e., executive) disorder is by targeting the point of performance, or the place and time across various settings of a person’s life where they are failing to act on what they know. Targeting the point of performance largely involves changing environments to facilitate performance. The following are key point-of-performance enhancements that work for people with ADHD:</p>
<h3>1. Externalize time</h3>
<p>Executive dysfunction renders internal cues unreliable, hence “time blindness” among people with ADHD. External representations of time — like calendars, white boards, visual timers (like the <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/product/time-timer-original-8-inch-time-management/"">Time Timer</a>), and other tools — may help guide behavior more reliably and effectively.</p>
<h3>2. Bring the future to the present</h3>
<p>If people with ADHD tend to wait until the future is imminent to act, then pushing the future back a few notches can help spur action. Dividing long-term goals into smaller, contiguous steps is one way to ensure constant action on an overall goal.</p>
<h3>3. Ensure motivation along the way</h3>
<p>Along with breaking up tasks into manageable chunks, people with <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-adhd-symptoms-causes-treatments/"">ADHD</a> will benefit from what I call motivational prostheses to sustain action toward a goal. The following are a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>short breaks in between longer bursts of work</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/getting-stuff-done-easier-with-a-friend-body-double/"">body doubles</a>, or accountability partners</li>
<li>visualizing rewards and positive outcomes</li>
</ul>

http://additudemag.com/rss,[Self-Test] Histrionic Personality Disorder,"<p><a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/histrionic-personality-disorder-hpd-symptoms/"">Histrionic personality disorder</a> (HPD) is characterized by persistent patterns of excessive emotionality and attention-seeking behaviors.<sup><a href=""#footnote1"">1</a></sup> People with HPD feel uncomfortable or unappreciated when they are not the center of attention, and they may go to great lengths — like inventing stories, creating a dramatic scene, and/or making inappropriate advances — to get the attention they crave.</p>
<p>People with HPD may display over-the-top, exaggerated emotional and behavioral responses to minor situations, often to the great discomfort of those around them. What’s more, they often exhibit <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/slideshows/adhd-emotions-understanding-intense-feelings/"">rapidly shifting emotions</a>. People with HPD are typically overly concerned with impressing others, especially by physical appearance, and they tend to be highly suggestible.</p>
<p>HPD occurs in less than 1% of the population<sup><a href=""#footnote2"">2</a></sup>, and is one of four Cluster B <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-personality-disorder-borderline-histrionic/"">personality disorders</a>, which include <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-borderline-personality-disorder-bpd-symptoms/"">borderline personality disorder</a> and <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/narcissistic-personality-disorder-symptoms-npd/"">narcissistic personality disorder</a>. These personality disorders are characterized by dramatic, emotional, and unpredictable behaviors.</p>
<p>According to one study, HPD appears to be the most common personality disorder among adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (<a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-adhd-symptoms-causes-treatments/"">ADHD</a>), with rates approaching 35%.<sup><a href=""#footnote3"">3</a></sup> Another study found that HPD was the most prevalent personality disorder among females with ADHD.<sup><a href=""#footnote4"">4</a></sup></p>
<p>If you suspect that you have symptoms of HPD, answer the questions below and share the results with a licensed mental health professional who is experienced in diagnosing and treating psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p><em>This self-test was adapted from the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire Fourth Edition Plus (PDQ-4), the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5) and from criteria outlined in the </em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)<em>. It is designed to screen for the possibility of HPD, and it is for personal use only. This test is not intended as a diagnostic tool. Only a licensed mental health professional can diagnose HPD.</em></p>

http://additudemag.com/rss,Middle School Tumult: ADHD Strategies to Ease Your Child’s Transition,"<p>The transition to middle school is a big adjustment for many adolescents with and without ADHD. Students who learned in one elementary school classroom with one teacher must adjust to switching settings and instructors several times each day. There are new faces, new rules, new routines, and new expectations.</p>
<p>Some <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/tag/middle-school/"">middle school students with ADHD</a> will benefit from assistance in understanding teachers’ directions and juggling multiple assignments. Here are ADHD-friendly strategies for parents:</p>
<h2>Middle School Strategies: Planning Ahead</h2>
<ul>
<li>Request a meeting with your student’s teachers prior to the new school year and have your child accompany you. Your child may feel embarrassed to tag along, but it is important to stress that kicking off a successful year means <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/parent-teacher-meeting-back-to-school-success"">meeting his teachers</a> face to face.</li>
<li>At this pre-planning meeting, be positive about <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/download/adhd-student-profile/"">your child’s strengths</a>. Have your student chime in with additions and clarifications. Inform each teacher about how your child responds best and where she may need assistance.</li>
<li>Get an idea about the types of assignments in the syllabus, how much time students get to complete them, how late work is penalized, and how the assignments are graded.</li>
<li>Ask how the teacher communicates homework assignments to students and parents—does she post on a website, for example?</li>
</ul>
<p><i>[<a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/download/explaining-adhd-to-teachers/?src=embed_link"">Free Download: Explaining ADHD to Teachers</a>]</i></p>
<h2>Middle School Strategies: Managing Assignments</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep a <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-brain-calendar-routine/"">visual calendar</a> or chart at home, where you and your student note assignments and due dates.</li>
<li>Establish a system in which your child does homework for 15 minutes (depending on his attention span), then engages in a preferred activity (ideally not a video game) for five minutes, and then back to homework. When the <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-and-homework-get-it-done-strategies-for-students/"">homework load</a> is heavy, have him do the easiest tasks first and praise him after each task.</li>
<li>Encourage your child to work ahead on longer-term assignments. Break them into small steps and set a deadline for each step. Show her how to do a portion of the assignment. Praise your child for working ahead of schedule.</li>
<li>If your child goes off task, don’t nag. Instead, say, “How can I help you?” or “It looks like you’re stuck on number 1. How about going on to number 2, and I will help you with number 1?”</li>
<li>Sometimes, finding a study buddy helps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, parents should be supportive and appreciate the changes that come with middle school. Use <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-praise-positive-parenting/"">praise</a> to reinforce good work habits and effort. Providing assurance along the way is critical for students’ success.</p>

http://additudemag.com/rss,Research: Celiac Disease May Be Linked to ADHD,"<p><em>August 8, 2022</em></p>
<p>Celiac disease ⁠— an autoimmune disorder that causes intolerance to gluten ⁠— may be linked to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), according to a systematic review recently published in <em>Children.<sup><a href=""#footnote1"">1</a></sup></em></p>
<p>The review, which comprises 23 studies that reference ADHD and <a href=""https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/celiac-disease/celiac-disease"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">celiac disease</a> published in the last two decades, found that more than half of those studies established a positive association between the conditions. Most of the studies that show a positive association were published in the last five years.</p>
<p>A 2021 study of 112,340 participants, for example, found that patients with celiac disease faced an increased risk for ADHD (OR: 1.75) compared to patients without celiac disease.<sup><a href=""#footnote2"">2</a></sup> A small study published the year prior of 73 pediatric patients with celiac disease found that 16% of the group also had ADHD, higher than the 9.4% prevalence of ADHD found in the general population.<sup><a href=""#footnote3"">3</a></sup> <sup><a href=""#footnote4"">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The review included a few small studies on the association between gluten-free foods, celiac disease, and ADHD. In one study, 15% of participants with ADHD who tested positive for celiac disease and subsequently avoided gluten for six months saw a reduction in <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-symptoms-checklist/"">ADHD symptoms</a>.<sup><a href=""#footnote5"">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The review builds on emerging research linking celiac disease to other conditions, including <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-autism-spectrum-disorder-asd/"">autism</a>, <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/types-of-anxiety/"">anxiety</a>, and mood disorders.<sup><a href=""#footnote6"">6</a></sup> A 2017 study (included in the systematic review) found that children with celiac disease had a 1.4-fold increased risk for psychiatric disorders later in life.<sup><a href=""#footnote7"">7</a></sup></p>
<p>The author of the review cautions that the referenced studies on celiac disease and <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-adhd-symptoms-causes-treatments/"">ADHD</a> differ considerably in methodology, diagnostic criteria, study design, number of participants, and other parameters that may impact reporting. More research is needed to understand celiac disease and its connection to ADHD.</p>

http://additudemag.com/rss,"What is Histrionic Personality Disorder? HPD Symptoms, Treatments & Causes","<h2>What is Histrionic Personality Disorder?</h2>
<p>Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD) is psychiatric condition associated with a pattern of attention-seeking behavior, inappropriate sexually seductive behavior, and discomfort with being outside the center of attention. People with HPD are overly dramatic and display exaggerated emotions<sup><a href=""#footnote1"">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>HPD is one of the rarest personality disorders, occurring in only 0.83% of the population<sup><a href=""#footnote2"">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>HPD is one of 10 <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-personality-disorder-borderline-histrionic/"">personality disorders</a> listed in the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> (<i>DSM-5</i>). Along with <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-borderline-personality-disorder-bpd-symptoms/"">borderline</a>, antisocial, and <a href=""/narcissistic-personality-disorder-symptoms-npd/"">narcissistic personality disorders</a>, HPD is a Cluster B disorder, which causes affected individuals to appear erratic, emotional, or dramatic.</p>
<h2>What are the Symptoms of Histrionic Personality Disorder?</h2>
<p>People with histrionic personality disorder exhibit at least five of the following symptoms in a variety of situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experiences discomfort when he or she is not the center of attention</li>
<li>Frequently displays inappropriate sexually provocative or seductive behaviors</li>
<li>Has shallow and fleeting emotions</li>
<li>Uses appearance to draw attention</li>
<li>Vague but highly emotional speech</li>
<li>Displays dramatized and exaggerated emotions</li>
<li>Is highly suggestible</li>
<li>Behaves as if relationships were more intimate than they are<sup><a href=""#footnote3"">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p><i>[<a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/histrionic-personality-disorder-test/?src=embed_link"">Self-Test: Symptoms of Histrionic Personality Disorder</a>]</i></p>
<h2>Other Signs of HPD</h2>
<p>People with HPD may struggle to form and maintain relationships, both platonic and romantic. They may alienate friends with inappropriate sexual behavior. They crave novelty and stimulation and are prone to becoming bored with their usual routine. Starting a project may feel invigorating, but they will often have trouble finishing, as they struggle with <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/delayed-gratification-adhd-curiosity/"">delayed gratification</a>. HPD is also associated with low self-esteem, which leads to the need for approval and attention<sup><a href=""#footnote4"">4</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>Causes of HPD</h2>
<p>HPD has no known definitive cause, however preliminary studies have shown <a href=""https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9743-histrionic-personality-disorder"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">potential roots of the disorder</a>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Genetics</strong>. HPD runs in families, so researchers theorize that there may be an underlying genetic link.</li>
<li><strong>Trauma</strong>. Trauma can change the way a child perceives the world, and therefore the way they interact with it, potentially resulting in HPD.</li>
<li><strong>Parenting.</strong> Most research into the cases of HPD has centered on parenting. HPD is correlated with permissive, over-indulgent parenting<sup><a href=""#footnote5"">5</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>HPD and ADHD</h2>
<p>Though HPD is uncommon, it is frequently comorbid with <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-adhd-symptoms-causes-treatments/"">ADHD</a>, with up to 35% of adults with ADHD meeting HPD criteria. HPD is the most common personality disorder among ADHD adults<sup><a href=""#footnote6"">6</a></sup>. HPD and ADHD have similar effects, such as difficulty with interpersonal relationships and delayed gratification. However, theatricality and inappropriate sexuality are unique to HPD, while hyperfocus points primarily to ADHD.</p>
<p><i>[<a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/borderline-personality-disorder-test-adults/"">Self-Test: Symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder</a>]</i></p>
<h2>Treating HPD</h2>
<p>Like many personality disorders, HPD is ego-syntonic, meaning that HPD sufferers often do not realize they have a problem. Ego-syntonic disorders are more difficult, though not impossible, to diagnose and treat.</p>
<p>HPD is most often treated with supportive psychotherapy that aims to improve self-esteem and coping skills in a patient, encouraging environment. Psychodynamic therapy, which aims to resolve unconscious conflicts and help patients understand themselves, is also effective. Some patients also benefit from <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-for-adhd/"">cognitive behavioral therapy</a> (CBT), which aims to help them unlearn negative patterns of thought and adopt healthier ways of thinking and interacting with the world.</p>
<p>Though there is no approved pharmacological treatment for HPD, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics may be helpful to reduce emotional dysregulation<sup><a href=""#footnote7"">7</a></sup>.</p>

http://additudemag.com/rss,Considering Collaborative Care? Here Are 5 Commonly Asked Questions,"<p>Integrated behavioral health care revolves around collaboration between primary care and behavioral health professionals in a shared setting. A pediatrician, psychiatrist, and social worker, for example, all share pertinent information about a patient in order to ensure that no health considerations or solutions are overlooked, no symptoms are misconstrued, no time or effort is wasted, and no pain points are left unaddressed.</p>
<p>Though this approach has produced improved outcomes for patients and clinicians, it is still largely underutilized. Following a recent ADHD Experts webinar titled “<a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/webinar/integrated-collaborative-care-adhd-children-teens/"">Integrated Care for Children with ADHD: How to Form a Cross-Functional Care Team</a>,” ADDitude editors provided answers (and relevant resources) to commonly asked questions on collaborative care. Find those responses below.</p>
<p><strong>Q1: “Why center integrated ADHD care around primary care doctors when you have access to mental health professionals?”</strong></p>
<p>A primary care provider (PCP) is one of few medical professionals with a whole-person approach to care. In many cases, the PCP has already established an in-depth, trusting relationship with the patient and family. They also act as an opportune gateway to additional healthcare services.</p>
<p>Rather than starting from scratch elsewhere, involving a PCP when seeking ADHD diagnosis and treatment options may save families time (and money). PCPs can initiate diagnostic assessments using validated screeners, exams, and patient history. In an integrated care model, they can also collaborate with psychiatrists and behavioral health care managers to develop, implement, and adjust treatment plans.</p>

<p><strong>Q2: “Does integrated care include help for children who experience social challenges associated with their ADHD? If so, who leads that effort?”</strong></p>
<p>Both the physical and behavioral needs of patients are addressed in an integrated care approach. Addressing social struggles in children with ADHD might fall first on the behavioral health care manager (BHCM), who acts as a linchpin between the medical care team and the child’s daily life. The BHCM partners with parents to outline goals and develop a plan while networking with schools and community agencies to provide accommodations and evidence-based treatment. Throughout this process, the BHCM is routinely updating the care team and monitoring patient progress.</p>

<p><strong>Q3: “How do I find an integrated care practice in my area?”</strong></p>
<p>Integrated care models are not standard, but they are becoming more common around large children’s hospitals and academic centers. If you live near a large children’s hospital, approach the primary care practice and ask if behavioral health is embedded in their pediatric clinics. Otherwise, talk to your pediatrician’s office to determine potential opportunities for collaborative care.</p>

http://additudemag.com/rss,“Q: How Can I Make Housework Stimulating?”,"<p><b>Q</b>: &#8220;Doing housework is flat-out boring. I have a hard time getting started, if I start at all. Then, because I wait so long between cleanings, the work seems overwhelming. How can I <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/slideshows/how-to-organize-your-home-room-by-room/"">make housework more manageable</a> and (maybe) enjoyable?&#8221;</p>
<p>Routine and a <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/focus-music-for-adhd-brains/"">good playlist</a> will help you. Here’s how to begin: Open a music app, or turn on a radio, and use this as a soundtrack for your nightly routine of cleaning the kitchen after dinner. If it is done every night, this task should not take more than 10 to 15 minutes. Then choose one other time of day — perhaps right after you get home from work — when you crank up the music and do a 10-minute (set an alarm) manic tidying, going room to room. Again, if done daily, 10 minutes should do it.</p>
<p>If the kitchen is clean and the home tidy, then <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/housekeeping-made-easy/"">deep cleaning</a> — a once-a-week chore alternating floors and baths—should not be overwhelming. Better yet, if you can afford it, get a housecleaner to come every other week for the floors and bathrooms. Finally, remember that the fewer items you own, the less there is to clean and tidy, so wherever possible, reduce possessions and commit to a <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/simplified-living-adhd-declutter-improving-child-behavior/"">minimalist lifestyle</a>. Good luck!</p>

http://additudemag.com/rss,When Schools Resist Evaluating & Addressing Learning Disabilities,"<p>Almost two-thirds of children with ADHD have at least one other condition, according to the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/conditions.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>; 45 percent are affected by <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/could-it-be-a-learning-disability/"">learning disorders</a>, 32 percent by anxiety, 17 percent by a mood disorder, and 14 percent by autism spectrum disorder. Yet despite the prevalence of co-occurring conditions, experts in the field — advocates, learning specialists, and psychologists — report that many students with ADHD do not receive <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-school-evaluation-iep-testing/"">assessments for common comorbidities</a>, at least initially.</p>
<h2>Jackson’s Story: Learning Differences Dismissed</h2>
<p>Third grade was not going well for Jackson* of Brooklyn, New York. Diagnosed with ADHD at age 5, Jackson was in an integrated co-teaching class with an <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/iep-vs-504-plan-idea-adhd-disability-education/"">IEP</a> in place, but his school aversion intensified with each passing day. “He would have these giant anxiety fits about going to school, saying, ‘I hate it! It’s boring!’” remembers his mother, Sarah.*</p>
<p>Before a parent-teacher conference, Sarah saw the other students’ writings hanging on the classroom walls and began to understand Jackson’s fears. “The other kids were writing full paragraphs and punctuating and spacing their words,” she says. “My jaw dropped. I thought, ‘Oh my God, what is going on? He is so far behind his classmates. How did I not know this?’”</p>
<p>When Sarah raised her concerns at Jackson’s <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/dear-additude-how-should-i-prepare-for-an-iep-meeting/"">IEP meeting</a> and asked for a learning disorder evaluation, she got pushback. “They were convinced that he couldn’t spell or write [because of] hard-headedness,” she explains. “The school was acting as though it was a behavior issue.”</p>
<p>Eventually, Jackson received a school evaluation as well as private neuropsychological testing. It revealed that, in addition to ADHD, Jackson had <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-dysgraphia-understanding-common-symptoms/"">dysgraphia</a> and was cognitively gifted. Now in sixth grade, he is thriving, thanks to an understanding of his learning needs and appropriate technologies and supports. But getting that game-changing set of diagnoses was an exhausting six-year process.</p>
<p><em>[<a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/download/learning-tools-reading-writing-skills/?src=embed_link"">Download: The Best Learning Tools for Students with ADHD and LD</a>]</em></p>
<p>“There was so much drama,” says Sarah. “The teachers were frustrated, and it was a miserable thing for my son to be constantly told to do something he was not in a position to do.”</p>
<h2>When ADHD is Blamed</h2>
<p>Jackson’s story, or some version of it, is familiar to most special education advocates. The repercussions of a missed diagnosis can be enormous to a child. Without the proper supports in place, kids will struggle and fall behind in school, losing invaluable opportunities for remediation during critical windows of growth. And this will have dramatic ripple effects emotionally, socially, and behaviorally, says Cheryl Chase, Ph.D., clinical psychologist and founder of <a href=""https://chasingyourpotential.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ChasingYourPotential.com</a>.</p>
<p>The problem begins with a lack of testing, says Susan Yellin, a lawyer and director of advocacy and transition services at the <a href=""https://www.yellincenter.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Yellin Center for Mind, Brain, and Education</a> in New York City. “A good evaluation has to be the starting place,” she says.</p>
<p>“If you don’t know what you’re dealing with, how can you fix it?” says Matt Cohen, a lawyer and past president of <a href=""https://chadd.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">CHADD</a>. “There are so many different areas where ADHD may overlap with, or may mask, other problems that a more in-depth evaluation is good practice. I would even argue it&#8217;s legally mandated… and a proactive responsibility.”</p>
<p><em>[<a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/parent-request-for-special-education-evaluation-for-adhd/?src=embed_link"">Read: How to Request a Special Education Evaluation</a>]</em></p>
<p>Under a mandate covered in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) called Child Find, public schools are required to &#8220;identify and evaluate all students who are reasonably suspected of having a disability.” This includes vision and hearing, social and emotional status, academic performance, and everything in between. In many cases, however, schools are not pursuing additional testing for kids with ADHD, despite requests from parents. The reasons for this include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Symptoms of co-occurring conditions are often mistakenly attributed to ADHD or are conflated with behavioral issues</li>
<li>School budget constraints limit testing and support services that might be required</li>
</ul>
<p>“When I see kids who are diagnosed with learning disabilities in sixth or seventh grade, they’ve had years of a script in their head that they’re stupid and not good enough,” says Roberto Olivardia, Ph.D., clinical psychologist and a clinical instructor of psychology at <a href=""https://hms.harvard.edu/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Harvard Medical School</a>. “Kids deal with that differently: Some get anxious, some get depressed, and some become the class clown.”</p>
<h2>When LD Red Flags Go Unnoticed</h2>
<p>The threads of multiple diagnoses can be difficult to untangle in a child with ADHD. “Co-existing conditions are often missed because the focal point, especially with hyperactive or impulsive kids, is on behavior that is perceived to be disruptive or problematic,” Cohen says. “And that’s as far as the initial investigation goes.”</p>
<p>This was the case for Bradley April of Milton, Washington. He was diagnosed with ADHD at age 4. It took five years, and several evaluations paid for by his family, before he was diagnosed with <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-dyslexia-symptom-overview-and-diagnosis-tips/"">dyslexia</a>. His mother, Kim April, recalls that Bradley’s explosive behavior began in first grade and steadily intensified until, by third grade, he was being removed from the classroom almost daily. “He was incredibly frustrated, and it was often expressed as avoidance, ripping up papers, flipping desks, and running from the classroom when he could not meet the expectations.”</p>
<p>April says it was obvious to her that reading “had not clicked” for Bradley, but no one suggested additional testing, despite the red flags and discrepancies. “I feel that the school saw his struggles as related to ADHD, and they didn&#8217;t look any further due to a lack of training, resources, or both,” says April.</p>
<p>Chase adds that the <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-executive-function-disorder/"">executive function challenges</a> posed by ADHD make uncovering learning disabilities especially challenging. If a child is inattentive or impulsive, how does an educator, therapist, parent, or even diagnostician know if the learning challenge stems from their executive functioning or another underlying issue? “You might not know,” Chase says. “But if you’ve got at least a couple of data points, including teacher and parent reports that he’s not reading well or that writing is a painful experience, for example, we can’t ignore that.” The next step, she says, should be further testing.</p>
<h2>Cutting Corners on LD Evaluations</h2>
<p>If experts agree that the best way to identify and address challenges is to evaluate a child fully and comprehensively, then why would schools ever resist additional assessments? “Unfortunately, sometimes, administrators are cutting corners on evaluations,” says Beverley Holden Johns, president of the <a href=""https://ldaillinois.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Learning Disabilities Association of Illinois</a>. “If you don’t do an evaluation that can determine a disability, you don’t have to provide additional services. It’s a way to save money.”</p>
<p>There’s an additional challenge, adds Olivardia: The evaluations that schools are equipped to offer may not be extensive enough to catch all co-occurring conditions. While a full neuropsychological evaluation isn’t usually necessary to diagnose ADHD, he says, it is the standard for assessing learning disabilities. And schools simply aren’t equipped to conduct these highly specialized, and expensive, evaluations.</p>
<p>Making education accessible for a child with ADHD tends to require <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/20-adhd-accommodations-that-work/"">accommodations</a> — preferential seating, reminders, building in breaks — that largely can be offered in a general education classroom at little additional cost to schools. But for other conditions, particularly learning disabilities, far more expensive interventions are necessary, including instruction by specialists.</p>
<p>Even so, Yellin reminds parents that every child is entitled to an appropriate, free education that meets their needs. “This is not a present from the school,” she says. “This is a right under federal law.”</p>
<h2>Taking a Closer Look</h2>
<p>Each of the comorbid conditions commonly found in <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-in-children-symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/"">kids with ADHD</a> has a different set of red flags. That said, the following signs should compel further investigation, according to Kathy Kuhl, a Virginia-based education consultant and founder of <a href=""https://www.learndifferently.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">LearnDifferently.com</a>.</p>
<p>Take additional steps if your child&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Continues to feel frustrated even though his ADHD is being managed</li>
<li>Avoids specific subjects at school</li>
<li>Refuses to go to school</li>
<li>Seems angry much of the time</li>
<li>Talks negatively about himself</li>
</ul>
<p>If you suspect a learning difference. . .</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Request an evaluation from the school in writing</strong>, Yellin says. A simple email stating, “I suspect my child has a disability and I am requesting an evaluation” will do. Under the IDEA, schools must investigate and evaluate all areas of suspected disability.</li>
<li><strong>If the school refuses to evaluate:</strong> You have two choices, Cohen explains:
<ul>
<li>Seek a due process hearing to request that the school evaluate the child</li>
<li>Get your child evaluated privately if you can afford it or if you can find low or no-cost options. The school district is obligated to consider those findings, but it is not bound by them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How SEPTA can help</h2>
<p>A Special Education PTA, or SEPTA, is a parent-teacher organization in which parents of children with special needs, often from different schools within one district, come together to share resources, build community, plan workshops on topics of interest, and serve as a united voice to advocate for special needs students.</p>
<p>If SEPTA is not in your district, you can form one. Reach out to your state’s PTA office and ask about how to get started. Members can include parents, guardians, teachers, aides, school therapists and administrators—anyone who wants to help support students with special needs.</p>

http://additudemag.com/rss,Study: Up to Two-Thirds of Children with ADHD Have Used Alternative Therapies,"<p><em>August 4, 2022</em></p>
<p>Up to two-thirds of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have used complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to address their symptoms, according to a new study published in the <em>Journal of Attention Disorders</em>.</p>
<p>Nutrition modifications; natural products, such as herbs, vitamins, and minerals; and mind-body practices like mindful meditation were the most-reported CAMs. The use of <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/asked-alternative-therapies/"">alternative therapies</a> was higher in families where the caregiver preferred natural therapies for ADHD and believed CAMs could synergistically boost conventional medicine.<sup><a href=""#footnote1"">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition, researchers found two predictive factors for <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-supplements-foods-vitamins/"">alternative therapy</a> use: parents’ education level (the more educated the parents, the more likely alternative therapies were used) and female gender.</p>
<p>“It seems that parents with higher education are open-minded,” the researchers wrote. “Additionally, they usually try Internet sources, books, and even magazines and other information sources to treat their children.”</p>
<p>The study found that more females opted for <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/integrative-medicine-adhd-holistic-health-wellness-guide/"">complementary and alternative medicine</a> than males. “One of the most important reasons for the higher CAM use in patients of the female gender is the fact that they usually employ more health services than males,” researchers said.<sup><a href=""#footnote2"">2</a></sup></p>
<p>For the study, researchers reviewed The Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed, and Scopus databases from inception to February 10, 2022, for reports of <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/slideshows/treating-adhd-without-medication/"">complementary and alternative medicine usage by patients with ADHD</a>. Data came from 12 original papers, which included a total of 4,447 patients, all younger than 18 years old.</p>
<p>To the researchers’ knowledge, this is the first systematic review to examine the prevalence, possible determinants, and type of alternative therapies used by patients with ADHD.</p>
<p>They recommended training healthcare providers on the most common CAM therapies and possible adverse effects or interactions with conventional medications. “They [healthcare providers] should have a deeper and more informed dialog about this matter with <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-adhd-symptoms-causes-treatments/"">ADHD</a> patients, which encourages them to disclose their CAM use,” researchers said.</p>
<p>This study had several limitations, such as only including articles published in English, and that most studies were from the U.S. and Australia.</p>

http://additudemag.com/rss,How to Demobilize a Bully in 5 Steps,"<p><strong>Q:</strong> &#8220;My daughter has ADHD and learning differences. She says she gets teased at school, but how can I tell if this is downright bullying?&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<h2>How to Stop Bullying at School</h2>
<p>Sadly, <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/bullying-more-prevalent-among-children-with-adhd/"">many neurodivergent kids experience bullying</a>, teasing, and/or taunting. Despite <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/how-to-deal-with-bullies-bullying-school-adhd-kids/"">anti-bullying policies</a> in schools and national efforts to raise awareness, kids with ADHD will likely find themselves as victims and/or aggressors at some point.</p>
<p>Yes, aggressors. Children and teens with <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-adhd-symptoms-causes-treatments/"">ADHD</a> may not realize when they’ve crossed the line from gentle ribbing into full-on bullying. Teasing is:</p>
<ul>
<li>often done with humor</li>
<li>is reciprocal</li>
<li>doesn’t affect self-esteem</li>
<li>will stop when it is no longer fun</li>
</ul>
<p>Taunting, on the other hand, involves ill will and continues or even escalates after the recipient is hurt or asks for the taunting to stop. Taunting is a form of bullying, and it is rampant in the upper elementary school grades, middle school, and early high school years.</p>
<p>Bullies often target individuals they perceive to be weak, vulnerable, and unable to defend themselves. It is repetitive, purposeful, and meant to cause harm or fear through the threat of further hostility. <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/slideshows/no-more-bullying-strategies-for-adhd-kids/"">Bullying</a> can be physical (hurting people), or it can be done through relational aggression (starting rumors, spreading gossip, and getting people to “gang up” on others).</p>
<p><i>[<a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/download/help-adhd-kids-make-friends/?src=embed_link"">Free Guide: Help Your Child Make Friends</a>]</i></p>
<p>Often, the roles of bully and victim are fluid. Kids who feel insecure or different from others are more likely to be aggressors at one time and then victims at another. Children and teens with ADHD may become <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/stop-bullying-at-school-adhd-children/"">targets for bullies</a> due to impulsiveness, clumsiness, and greater challenges navigating awkward conversations and reading body language. They also may not realize when they are in danger of being targeted or attacked.</p>
<p>Sometimes the bullied becomes a bully. The same impulsivity and social challenges that put kids with ADHD at risk for bullying may also lead them to take out their frustrations on others.</p>
<p>A bully’s motivations may include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A desire to fit in with or be accepted by “cool” or “popular” kids</li>
<li>Peer pressure</li>
<li>A defense mechanism: “If I bully others, then others won’t bully me”</li>
<li>To increase social status: “I feel stronger/smarter/better when I put others down”</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Deal with A Bully: 5 Steps</h2>
<p>To teach kids to respond effectively to bullying, support them with these interventions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Encourage your child to speak up in non-provocative ways to assert strength</strong>. Bullies will do a few practice taunts to test someone, create drama, and stir things up. If their insults provoke a reaction, they will continue. Your child can shut this down by standing up and saying: “What did you say to me?” or “What did you mean by that?” Or your child can interrupt the bully mid-sentence, say his name, and change the conversation. Try role-playing with your child to practice this.</li>
<li><strong>Create an exit strategy</strong>. Discuss techniques and phrases to use to extricate your child from an uncomfortable situation. Explore ways for your child or teen to engage the assistance of their true friends in socially tricky situations.</li>
<li><strong>Remind your child that he is not alone</strong>. Point out his true friends and encourage time spent together. For younger children, facilitate these meetups; for older ones, ask if they’d like to invite a friend over. Ask the school for help in fostering positive connections through project collaborations with like-minded individuals. Make sure that teachers are aware of the social dynamics your child is facing.</li>
<li><strong>Help your child build self-awareness</strong> about statements, actions, or facial expressions that might be misinterpreted as hostile. Try saying: “Hey, are you aware of the volume of your voice right now? Can you bring it down a notch?” Seek out feedback from teachers about possible off-putting behaviors or habits that they notice.</li>
<li><strong>Create a safety plan</strong> that details what to say or do to <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/dear-additude-my-adhd-child-is-being-bullied/"">stop bullying</a> when it occurs in person or online: whom to talk to (a friend or adult), where to go at school (the office of the nurse or counselor), and how to minimize reacting.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nurture self-confidence in your child or teen by identifying her interests and capabilities, developing skills and pride in these areas, acknowledging her efforts as well as her accomplishments, and staying compassionate and steady in your relationship.</p>

<h2>How to Become An Upstander</h2>
<p>Encourage your child to recognize situations in which they are bystanders. Ask them to reflect on their feelings about what they see. Explain what it means to be an <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/webinar/add-and-relationships/"">upstander or someone who intervenes on behalf of a person being bullied</a> by speaking or acting out. Discuss how your child can role model prosocial behavior, inclusivity, and other appropriate and safe ways to be an upstander, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Welcoming others to join their activities and groups</li>
<li>Showing kindness, respect, and empathy for others</li>
<li>Walking or sitting with vulnerable kids who may be targets of bullying</li>
<li>Intervening as a group by enlisting the help of other friends who dislike or fear the bully</li>
<li>Changing the subject when a taunting conversation begins</li>
<li>Questioning the bullying behavior by asking to do something else</li>
<li>Using humor to lighten up a serious situation</li>
<li>Stating approval of the victim and validating his or her social status</li>
<li>Reaching out privately to the target to express support and concern</li>
<li>Reporting the bullying to a trusted adult, parent, teacher, or school administrator</li>
<li>Reaching out privately to the person doing the bullying to express concern, if you feel safe to do so</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, tell your child how proud you are of them when they show compassion and help targets of bullying. Help them identify the positive emotions resulting from their good deeds. Having a strong sense of self will prevent your child from becoming a bully, and it will teach her <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/teach-adhd-child-about-bullying/"">how to stop bullying</a> effectively when others bully her or other classmates.</p>

http://additudemag.com/rss,Study: Emotional Dysregulation Improved with ADHD Medication Use,"<p><em>August 3, 2022</em></p>
<p>Psychopharmacological treatments for ADHD are likely to improve emotional behaviors in adults with <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/desr-adhd-emotional-regulation/"">deficient emotional self-regulation</a>, according to a study published in the <em>Journal of Attention Disorders</em>.<sup><a href=""#footnote1"">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In a review of 14 clinical trials of <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-in-adults/"">adults with ADHD</a> available on PubMed, researchers found that 13 reports showed methylphenidate, atomoxetine, or lisdexamfetamine treatment interventions had a positive impact on at least one measure of emotional behavior. <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/medication/methylphenidate/"">Methylphenidate</a> (brand names Concerta, Ritalin, Daytrana, Jornay PM, Quillivant XR, and others) and atomoxetine (brand name <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/medication/strattera/"">Strattera</a>) showed the greatest improvement.</p>
<p>“Undesirable emotional expression patterns are common in a range of mental health conditions identified in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual classifications of disorders,” the researchers wrote. “However, evidence suggests that impaired emotional regulation may be integral to some versions of ADHD.”</p>
<p>Researchers also compared changes in emotional behavior to changes in ADHD symptom ratings such as inattention and impulsivity/hyperactivity. Treatment effects ranged from 46% to 110% for methylphenidate, 56% to 129% for atomoxetine, and 36% to 96% for <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/medication/vyvanse/"">lisdexamfetamine</a>.</p>
<p>“These findings suggest these treatments can have favorable effects on patterns of emotional expression, and that these effects are measurable using available rating scales.”</p>
<p>The current study included trials with systematic, validated measures conducted under controlled conditions and with treatment interventions that were replicated in another study. Emotional behavior measures included ratings from interviewing clinicians, observers, and self-reports.</p>
<p>Though not comparable to the current study, a review of behavioral therapies found cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness interventions also had a positive impact on emotional control in unmedicated adults.</p>

http://additudemag.com/rss,Q: “How Can I Help My Child Remember His Homework and Books?”,"<p><b>Q</b>: “How can I help my son, who has ADHD, remember to take his homework, books, and lunch to school each day? I’m running up to his school at least twice a week to bring him what he left at home that morning.”</p>
<p>It is essential that your son <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/4-rules-for-keeping-a-backpack-organized/"">pack up his backpack</a> the night before and leave it by — maybe even blocking — the door he exits. For things he takes every day, I suggest making a mnemonic sung to the tune of “head, shoulders, knees, and toes” but modified to his items. So it could be: “Lunch, homework, keys, and phone.” Of course, this doesn’t address one-time items, such as permission slips, or weekly items, like gym shoes and musical instruments.</p>
<p>Weekly and regular <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/slideshows/daily-routine-for-adhd-child/"">routines</a> can go on a large weekday matrix that is hung by the door, so he knows on Tuesday night to pack his shoes for gym on Wednesday. One-time items can be jotted on a neon Post-It or noted on a phone with a reminder text or a memo, whichever is most convenient and effective for him at the moment. His most valuable tool, however, is you.</p>

<p>It may take a month to get him in the habit of packing up the night before, checking the matrix and reminder notes, and placing everything in front of the door. You should be there in the morning to “run the tune.” A good month of this should make it a habit. You might not completely eliminate your trips to the school, but they should become fewer. And best of all, Mom, you will have taught him a valuable <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/organization-systems-that-work/"">organizing system</a> that he can use for the rest of his life.</p>
